A11N155CW1UV02	B000H00VBQ	AdrianaM	I had big expectations because I love English TV, in particular Investigative and detective stuff but this guy is really boring. It didn't appeal to me at all.,	2	A little bit boring for me,	05-03-2014
AUX8EUBNTHIIU	B000H0X79O	Louis V. Borsellino	Not bad.  Didn't know any of the comedians but first time viewing put a smile on my face.  I'll check out the next season soon.,	3	Entertaining Comedy,	04-02-2014
AXM3GQLD0CHIL	B000H0X79O	Ray Shiva	Funny, interesting, a great way to pass time. I usually enjoy standup comedy and is this is a good show for me.,	4	Worth watching!,	02-07-2014
A398QSASJOIKA6	B000H29TXU	Amazon Customer	I love the variety of comics.  Great for dinner TV entertainment because of length of each episode.  Many of the featured comics have gone on to even bigger TV specials so it's great to see some of their earlier material.,	4	comedy club quality without leaving your home,	02-06-2014
A2U61O0KWJH3MM	B000H29TXU	Cathy P.	comedy is a matter of taste. this guy was a little funny but there are others that are far funnier than this guy,	3	ok,	09-05-2013
AO1Z63O9CTT95	B000H29TXU	James Westervelt	he's OK. His humor consists mainly of varying between a Vietnamese accent and a smooth articulate presentation of ironic situations.,	2	same routine he did on last comic standing,	03-06-2014
A1378ZJMWCTVT3	B000H2DMME	Alla	some comedians are very good, some not so good, and some are just not funny.  I don't know the names to chose from and watched this by picking random episodes. However, I do know some big names in stand up comedy and these were not included on prime.,	3	it was ok,	01-09-2014
A2LSZFEFTDRDIJ	B000H2DMME	debra marrero	Enjoyed some of the comedians, it was a joy to laugh after losing my father whom I was a caregiver for,	5	Some were funny,	02-10-2013
A3RXD7Z44T9DHW	B000H2DMME	Kansas	All the comedians are hilarious. I have seen them all before on Comedy Central but what a great idea to put them all together. I love Amazon prime and I love their shows. They are so much better than Netflix. I got rid of my Netflix Amazon rocks and Netflix well it thymes with rocks but in a bad way.,	5	kansas,	03-06-2014

AYCGI5JRRISTJ	B000H2DMME	Roger Keith Ing	I loved the humor of the stand-up comics featured here. I only got the free episode listed at the beginning of the season, but it probably gives a good idea of what is contained in the rest of the season. I have actually watched several episodes of this season when I was having a free 30-day trial membership in Amazon prime, which I eventually plan to become a paid subscriber to.,	5	Very Funny,	03-09-2013
A1939G7K0LLQ8P	B000H2DMME	Rugby	It was fine - not my favorite but a comic on her way up. Some of the same cliche material I hear from others but a spark if the individual world view comes to the fore.,	3	A Matter of Preference,	04-09-2012
A2LUBUMIQEVWD3	B000H2DMME	Tristan Tristan	It is nice to see some of the more popular comedians when they were first starting out. You can tell why some made it big and some didn't. If you like stand up comedy, I recommend giving it a try.,	3	Pretty good but not great,	01-02-2014

A1NF9WS7RR82MX	B000H4YNM0	J. Hill	Out of all the new comedies that have come out in the last ten years, Sunny is as the top of my list.  You need an affinity for quirky, offbeat humor to enjoy it, not to mention a high tolerance for raw language and sexual humor.  The first season consisted of just seven episodes, but established the core characters and operators of Paddy&#8217;s Pub; owners Dennis, Mac, and Charlie, and waitress/Dennis&#8217;s twin sister Dee.  In Season 2 (ten episodes), Danny Devito comes on board as Frank, Dennis and Dee&#8217;s dad.  The show&#8217;s creators (Rob McElhenney/ Mac; Glenn Howerton/Dennis; and Charlie Day/Charlie) are hilarious as actors, and also as writers.  Every character on the show stands out and gets big laughs out of me.  It&#8217;s one of those great ensemble casts that&#8217;s incredibly balanced in terms of the personalities and comedic nature of each character, resulting in a consistently high level of quality in every episode.  These first two seasons have some of my favorites, including &#8...	5	It's Always Funny in Philadelphia,	01-08-2014
A356RFKNIG043B	B000H4YNM0	K. Swanson	4.5 starsI knew nothing of this until a friend lent it to me this weekend. I laughed. Often. At things that aren't supposed to be funny, but as any serious fan of comedy knows, those can be the best laughs. I walked away feeling lighter and happier. If that ain't comedic success, what is?IASIP is like Seinfeld if the SeinFour were ten years younger, Irish, and ran a bar in South Philly. These guys have clearly studied Sein and Curb very closely, and their tight timing and topics and banter are all very Larry Davidesque...but they go places even LD won't. The best two shows of the 7-episode first season are about cancer and abortion; I howled at some moments. These guys have done what so many guys want to do: make a show about how funny they are. Except, these guys really are funny. Sometimes. But hey, no one's always hittin' homers, even on comedy 'roids, so I cut these three some slack and marvel at how tightly they work together. There's a lot to be said for working with old friends, if they have talent:...	5	It's Very Often Funny In Philly: occasionally hilarious in all the best wrong ways,	08-08-2010
A2QWF2BJ2FM4R2	B000H4YNM0	Lovblad	This series revolves around 4 friends who run a bar in Philadelphia and who go through a variety of difficult but extremely funny and often extravagant situations. I had heard of the series previously but was only convinced of buying it after seeing an intervewi with the actress. What a suprise: this is a somewhat lesscorrect version of Friends meets My Name Is Earl. I agree that this may not be correct at all since this series has no respect for conventional moarl issues such as lying about having cancer, discovering a friend's grandfather was a nazi. It also tackles the strange love men sometimes has for guns ets... In some ways it is difficult to describe and understand if you have not seen this gem of comedy.,	5	Hilarious,	10-06-2008
A1GUJPIEN0XH4Q	B000HAB4NK	Amazon Customer	Wish I had watched this show when it began back in 2001.  Very happy that it is available from Amazon to stream.  I've watched 5 seasons in 3 weeks!  Will keep you on the edge of your seat (if you suspend reality a little bit).  Highly recommend!,	5	Love it!,	08-07-2013

A3ENBNVNDMFOPK	B000HAB4NK	JKLangstrom	Just finished the 5th season of this very riveting series. I must admit the season started off with a Bang! When you watch it you will see what I mean. However, about mid season I had to push myself a little to get through to the last 1/3 of season, and I am SO glad I did! WOW! talk about being on the edge of my seat. This season really does have more of an edge to it. A fictional Syntox gas, nerve agent,  is involved, terrorist plots, political corruption and some of the main characters are bumped off! Loved this season and would highly recommend it to anyone!,	5	Great 5th Season!,	05-10-2014
A2I6MHMAZZDCRX	B000HAB4NK	Mark Baker	In the aftermath of season 4, Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) had to fake his own death and go into hiding.  But he can't seem to stay in retirement for long.  Someone knows Jack is alive and targets his friends, forcing Jack to come out of hiding to face down terrorists yet again.Meanwhile, it is an important day for the United States and President Logan (Gregory Itzin).  He has been working hard to iron out an anti-terrorism treaty with Russia, and that treaty will be signed that day.  But the treat of terrorists in Los Angeles with stolen nerve gas just might be enough to derail the treaty.Season 5 won an Emmy for best drama, and it was well deserved.  Even after five years, this show is gripping drama with excellent writing and acting.  I am glued to my seat every week, breathing only during commercial breaks.  This season the threat and storytelling seemed more focused then previous years, adding to the drama.There were a couple flaws this season.  I sure don't remember the explanation of who knew Jack...	5	A Little Wear but Still Strong Fifth Season,	12-05-2006

Of course, Kiefer and the regular cast absolutely rock, it was fantastic to see as much of Agent Pierce as we did this season, and Gregory Itzen and Jean Smart...... well, what can I say about them other than === shoulda won the Emmys!!!,	5	Go JACK!,	07-07-2007

A2U5WUR3YCVOLI	B000HAB4NK	St Johns	I enjoyed nearly all the seasons of 24 and this is probably my third year I have watched them.  So excited they are bringing the show back though it may be somewhat different.  I enjoy dramas such as &#34;24&#34; and &#34;Covert Affair&#34;.  Good luck to the 24 actors and crew and hope the new show will do well.,	4	24,	02-01-2014

A2YODUWYK547ID	B000HKWE3O	Wayne A. Seavolt	James Bond minus the adult stuff.  Great show that shows the mind is still the best weapon.  Sure there is some liberal stuff thrown in but it is family friendly.  And who can't resist the MacGyverisms as you think could that work.  Maybe not but it will make the kids think and want to experiment.  Good stuff for the whole family.,	5	MacGyverism,	02-12-2014

AB0GGIQBNB36Q	B000HZEHL6	Ben Milton	Season three opens, with Gibbs going after Kate's killer, Ari. And to try to throw alot at us, NCIS gets a new director, Jenny Shepard played by Lauren Holly. Now Shepard and Gibbs do have some history, since both were partners at NCIS at one time, also. To proclaim Ari's innocence, is Massade officer Ziva David. And I'm sorry, I didn't like her then. And I don't liker her now, She and pretty much all of Massad is built up like they are the only agents that are extremely tough, they're unstoppable. So Ziva and Jenny try to convince Gibbs that he's wrong, and Gibbs even makes the only logical argument against Ari's innocence. That if he were innocent, he would turn himself in. So, after much arguing, he gets Ziva to follow him. And Ziva kills Ari in Gibb's basement, And we get each persons view of how they saw Kate in this episode. Now, I would have inserted Paula Cassidy to the team after this. Since there was some obvious chemistry between her and tony, but no. We get Ziva, and she is built up like I said...	4	Still a solid season,	09-07-2012
A1BLPBS90I0GRK	B000HZEHL6	D. C. Holbrook Dee	Love having the Instant View feature on Amazon.com. I have used this feature many times and will do again. Would highly recommend to friends and family.,	5	Great Episode of NCIS,	08-06-2012
APL6O92MS25MJ	B000HZEHL6	H. Jeanne Rockwell	This series has it all in the &#34;crime&#34; solving genre:  Great cast, humor, story lines and gadgetry to keep you coming back for more.  Especially enjoy the new addition replacing Kate's character.,	4	Good cast and good story lines,	08-04-2013
A2RD1DGD4B61ZT	B000HZEHL6	Kris	This said it was used but you couldn't tell. The box had just a little wear on the corners other then that it looked new. Would order from them again.,	5	Great,	01-09-2013
A317L56T9Q55C2	B000HZEHL6	William Webster disgusted	This serries is OK, but it really lacks the substance that Criminal Minds, MI-5, CSI or Alias has.  The list goes on. When is the second season of Bones and Criminal Minds coming out?,	3	It's good, but not great.,	03-11-2007

If you are a true Doctor Who fan than you can not miss watching these classic, see all of its humble beginnings.Only thing we have seen that is a problem, is that there if several seasons missing, it would be nice to watch every Doctor Who up to date today.,	5	It is Doctor Who (Classic) Season 1 what else is there to say,	12-12-2013
A2B913IHK6DJXN	B000I5PVD8	dvdjhll	I used to watch this as a kid. We could only get it when the atmospheric conditions were just right and the tv antenna was turned to just the right direction to get the one station that played this at 10pm. They would show this as a double feature with Dark Shadows. It is fascinating to see how much has changed in how we treat each other and how tv is made.,	2	Not a full season and no the best episodes of the season,	05-11-2013
A1THRWHZHFQ5TC	B000I5PVD8	E. Chen	They've come a long way since the original Dr. Who. I still like the latest versions. If you are a Dr. Who fan, then these episodes give you a taste its origins... OK, but corny.,	3	OK for tradition sake,	07-05-2013
AUK6ECH59NWS7	B000I5PVD8	Eric Schneider	Same review as season 5.  Too old, short of nostalgia no real reason to watch.  Give each episode 5 min for future reference.,	3	50 year old Sci-fi is OLD!!,	12-02-2013
AUK6ECH59NWS7	B000I5Q0ZG	Eric Schneider	Season 12-16 are getting the same review.  Tom Baker (my dad's favorite) fits not only the role of the Doctor, but also time in Earth 'real time'.  The introduction of the sonic screwdriver, New companions which continue to defy the command 'stay here!!' Short episodes make this a great binge.  The cerebral side of the Doctor as well as 'the classic Dr.smile' grow into the story line.,	4	Tom Baker's tenure as our favorite time traveler,	12-02-2013
A1IDIJQ3VUMMP9	B000I5Q0ZG	Jeff SC	Compared to today the special effects are comical, but that justs adds to the fun of watching these old shows,	4	Good stuf,	06-03-2013
A2PI8HT5LKH9BQ	B000I5Q0ZG	watchman	Hi, it was great to get to watch these episodes (The Ark In Space) that I never saw before, especially on Prime.  But...most of the season's episodes are not available. If they had everything available including classics about the Daleks, Crinoids, etc. this series would be a home-run. Also, Tom Baker is my favorite childhood version of Dr. Who, which is another reason why I would love to see everything featuring him available on Amazon Instant Video.,	3	Good start but need whole season,	09-06-2013
A3K0E9JKGAHI5T	B000I5RENI	B. Kimball	The older Dr. Who series always has a theatre quality to it. Tom Baker is the Doctor I grew up with, so it feels good to stop by and see these episodes again. This one features Romana, one of the better companions I feel (though she was kind of forced on the Doctor).Generations today always want a female Time Lord (ok by me), and well, there you go. Romana is a Time &#34;Lady&#34;. She's as smart as the Doctor, but lacks the experience he has traveling the universe.  She also seems to usually be very calm in a tight situation against his silly antics some times. They make a good pair.So if you ever wanted to see what a female Time Lord (excuse me, Lady) might be like, check out these episodes.,	5	Good episodes,	03-08-2014
AF3L9HOKN1LHJ	B000I5RENI	Erica	It is great filling in some of the blanks of what happened to that character or how did the doc meet this character! it would be great if you would get more missing episodes .,	5	Well it's been great since the 1960's, so it's great.,	12-05-2013
AUK6ECH59NWS7	B000I62JFU	Eric Schneider	Everything has to start somewhere but as a viewer there is only so much nostalgia one can have for sci-fi.  Thus is a 50 year old season and it shows.  Campy at best.  If you want a good starting point for Dr. Who I suggest starting with Dr. #3 in app 1970.  This is also the start of color. That being said seeing Cybermen as an original 'bad guy' shows the connection to the past.,	3	Nostalgia is good but this is really too old,	12-02-2013
ABVYGB2TKBO8F	B000I8FOZA	J. Donaldson Cal-diver	Some are better than others but overall I enjoyed these. In many cases I was surprised at the enormity of effort, design, and equipment required to do these big jobs.,	4	Really enjoyed most of these episodes,	12-07-2012
ASCWWM8JQE0IE	B000I8FOZA	L. Crist tronicsjunkie	Love to see where men build and keep striving for better.  It's nice to live in a day when things naturally progress.,	4	Love these shows,	03-12-2014
A2EV34WFAYU8JO	B000I8FOZA	Lurch	Not the best show ever made but you do learn.  I would love more in depth info but I do understand there is only so much that a show can divulge.  But I will say you will learn a lot and some episodes are done very well others not so well.  But hey give it a shot you may have an engineer in you waiting to get out.,	4	Some good info you will get some cool info,	02-12-2014
A1B9B1YZYS3B0S	B000I8FOZA	Thanks I Needed That	The series is in the older square video version.  Made for the older TV types, but it's still a great series.  Inspirational and mind boggling.  Some of the amazing things they come up with are absolutely incredible.,	5	This whole series is awesome,	02-02-2014
A3S3KU23F9TAAP	B000I8H2ZU	Amazon Customer	These guys are great and they have a fantastic team. There have been a couple of knock-off shows that weren't even in the same galaxy as the Mythbusters. I would give 7 stars if I could!!,	5	What I want to be when i grow up! --I'm 65 by the way,	07-11-2013
A2LZDPPCDRUBG6	B000I8H2ZU	Bazajaytee Bazajaytee	I've been a Mythbusters fan for a long time and while I'm still not used to the US narrator (coming from the UK where it is narrated by a Brit) I made my way through all the Mythbusters series again on Amazon Prime.The show takes us through those things we always thought we knew about but often didn't. Watching the whole seasons through, it is obvious that while Adam and Jamie were younger in this season they were also a lot angrier at each other. Perhaps they learned each others quirks as the seasons progressed but it is interesting to go back to the early days. You can also view how the budget for the show started increasing over time as their initial experiments were low cost and generally done near the shop, now they have massive explosions in man made lakes and mining quarrys.I recommend this show to my friends and it is often discussed in the work place. Everyone with an interest in science, explosions and humour should be watching this show.,	5	Informative and entertaining,	02-08-2013
AL5P6IG4WZ57J	B000I8H2ZU	Faye Hollidaye Faye	Interesting and kind of educational. Though the filming isn't the best possible at all times, this is a great show for those of us who wonder about what's true and what's not. I highly recommend for everyone who's curious, and those who like scientific explanations for things.,	4	Good show,	07-07-2013
A1AU4WG25D1M1I	B000I8H2ZU	Some Guy	I've always enjoyed Mythbusters. Glad this show has gone as long as it has because I can always pull up an episode and be entertained even though I've seen most of them before.,	5	One of my favorite shows.,	12-07-2013
A3AQ6Z6SRTSIS3	B000I9S5BE	Jo Ann Winternheimer	Granddaughter, age 5, can't get enough of Blues Clues Season 1.  I must say tho that when she viewed later seasons that changed Steve's role to another guy, she didn't like it.  So she watches the seasons with the original Steve over and over.,	5	Excellent fun,	03-06-2014
A21HGY8ABK1S3B	B000I9S5BE	Louis Diana	Very instructional and cute. Both my 7 year old and 1 1/2 year old love the show! More seasons for Prime members to stream!!,	5	Great show for kids,	07-02-2013

A2RM5ZSZJQL7WY	B000I9S5BE	Susan E Crangle	There are a lot of kids' shows that are super, super annoying.  This one is cheesy, but it is sweet, and I especially love Steve.  I love how this show teaches kids about deduction and gives them the chance to solve mysteries.,	5	Cheesy, but I love it anyway,	02-12-2014
AEQKBT65V9ZQ6	B000I9S5BE	Wayne E. Delong	My children love this show. I will give a great example from my four year old from last week. We come to a stop sign and she reads S T O P and says that spells stop. We were really impressed, we have been working on letters for quite a while now, but she could comprehend  stop means stop. We  asked her if she learned it in K-3. She said no she learned it on blues clues. Just a side note I know some people are going to read this and say. Well if he didn't have his kid in day care they would be smart... or something of that ilk. Our children are in a small Christian school and they didn't have enough teachers so my wife became a full time volunteer to help the kids. I'm not a fan of preschool, I do not sit in judgment of those who do. It's just a personal choice for us. Back to the show my children have learned so much from this show. hope this helps.,	5	Great great great show,	04-05-2014

The plot lines are simple and easy for her to understand, (she is a preschooler), and she was really engaged.  She loved being a part of the story when Dora asked her to participate.

A1BZO0THZKLQE4	B000IBUIS0	Linda Sheean	Always buy this series, and am sorry that it is, as a weekly show, ending.Therefore it is good to be able to have the last season (I have all the others) as it is one of the best in the field - science fiction - apart from old faithful Star Trek. Always miss Richard Dean Anderson, that wry and handsome wit, but Shanks and Browder, let alone Claudia Black, what a terrific actor! more than make up for his loss. I always wish more of Amanda Tapping's abilities apart from sheer mathematics that she is forced by plot to come out with at least four or five times per episode could be utilized in more interesting directions, but she is the greatest also. Look forward to her in Stargate Atlantis.Stargate SG-1 season 10 is a worthy product and has been added to my collection with great satisfaction.Linda Sheean,	5	Stargate SG-1,	09-09-2007

ABHFDY6XU5Z3B	B000IBUIS0	S. Jackson	This is a spin off from the movie Star Gate with Kurt Russell and James Spader.  The series starts up where the movie left off.The shows were well written, and the acting was good.Of course Richard Dean Anderson gave the show its' sense of humor. Give the show a try.  Based on science fiction it was the cast that gave Stargate SG 1 a 10 year run on TV.,	4	Fun,	06-04-2014
A234PK90SOCFSF	B000IBUP6A	Christopher Beckwith	I was very pleased to find this on Criterion's pre-release list, but not surprised - it's just the sort of little-known cinematic gem that Criterion does wonders with. In fact, I've been looking for a copy of this for some time, having first seen Eddie Coyle years and years ago, the memory of the film's stark realism and mood etched in my mind like few others. This is definitive 70's Noir and a title fully worthy of a pull-out-all-the-stops release that Criterion consistently provides.  What a fine addition to the Criterion title catalogue, the choice reflecting - as usual - an impeccable sense of film history on the part of Criterion's staff.,	5	Bravo Criterion!,	04-08-2009
A1K57CP4QTYR6S	B000ICRKLM	David E. Meadows Igor	Phenomenal set of writers who seem to know how to keep the series action packed and with characters who the audience enjoy watching.  Strongly recommended for the SCI-FI junkies in the world.,	5	Finished Season 3 and on to Season 4,	05-07-2014
A1K7R1U4QZS3W2	B000ICRKLM	Donna Dreamseeker	I love this series. This is the third or fourth time through for me. The characters of John Shepherd, Tayla, Dr Weir, Ronan and Dr. Becket and Dr McKay are unforgettable. It is a wonderful space fantasy. Whenever I want to escape into another world I go to Stargate Atlantis. I imagine how cool it would be to travel to other worlds through a stargate/wormhole and meet other people who of course speak my language, English. The SG-1 series is good too and was the beginning of the Stargate series. In the beginning of Stargate Atlantis Jack O'Neil passes the torch to John Shepherd. Very cool indeed.,	5	Wonderful Space Fantasy,	10-04-2013

A2A6NH6DPE0VXR	B000IJRK7O	Jim Pimmy	From beginning to end of season 2 Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller) and his brother Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell) are on the run from the police and government agents that want them dead. The other convicts lives are on the line as well since all of them have been ordered to be killed. They also want Dr. Sara Tancredi (Sarah Wayne Callies) dead or anyone else who has tried to help Scofield and his brother. To show that these guys aren't messing around, season 1 regular Veronica (Robin Tunney) is killed violenty at the end of the first episode of this season.William Fichtner plays Agent Alexander Mahone who we think just wants to catch them but it later turns out that he has been ordered to kill them. Plus that's not all that makes this guy a threat....he's extremely smart and always seems to know what Scofield's next move is going to be. Which is another thing that makes this season so thrilling. You never really know what this guy is going to do next or who he's going to find next. I was hoping he'd...	4	A Non-Stop Edge of Your Seat Season!,	05-12-2007
A1ATHDILELXROF	B000IJRK7O	Renee L Williams	It was interesting how the roles became reversed.  Michael is now the prisoner in one of the worst prisons possible and the brother is now the free man.  Talk about twist of fate.  I was excited to see T-bag back in the second season.  He's a mean, rotten man, but somehow he just grows on you.  You kind of believe there's some good in there, some where.,	5	Terrific as the first season.  You definitely want to get it.,	04-04-2014

A1HKBX2L0DV258	B000IK882Y	Dena Leasure	The Bones tv series is a great show.  David Boreanaz and Emily Deschanel work so good together and even though it is a crime drama, there are also plenty of light moments that will make you laugh.

A2QDPJRVXL7P4F	B000IK882Y	Sahra Badou Bibliophile	I really enjoyed this TV series, and I found it superior to season one.In season two, the relationship between Dr. Brennan and Booth is well developed, albeit unpredictable, especially with the newly introduced and sexy new boss. There are a lot of tensions, thrills, passions, conspiracies, and sex in this season. Some episodes were extremely well though-off and intriguing. I did like the most the episode on the astronaut. Are there aliens from outer space, and did one just fall down to Earth? Watch the episode to find out.This series will teach you a lot of medical terms as well as how crimes are committed (and how not to commit crimes).,	5	Entertaining and educational show.,	07-06-2008
AR6MI6AVH9YML	B000IK882Y	V Johnson	The interaction between Bones and Booth got even better this season.  The change in other characters helped develop the series.,	5	Second season even better,	01-07-2014
A1REM7I2ZEE195	B000IKP5AM	D. Christensen	Love this series and watch it over and over.  I am sure many people who watch it know a person like Hyacinth, which makes it even more humorous.  I am so happy I can watch it any time I want a good laugh with my Premium membership.,	5	Hilarious,	06-07-2013

AMOS0E4FEHZQC	B000IKQX44	Carol J. Rader crdvm	While I liked this mini-series enough to but all 5 parts- I was disappointed in the non-ending . Maybe there was supposed to be more story later? Major characters are tossed away. I wouldn't see it again.,	3	aliens invading,	07-09-2013
AHIK7BUXFRMT8	B000IKQX44	David Bower	Overall the mini-series was well handled and held my interest right up to the end. The end, however, was more of a stopping point than a wrap-up as it left most of the important questions unanswered.This one may be good to-rent for those who are die-hard science fiction fans but will have a limited audience in others. I enjoyed watching it once but will probably not watch it again.,	4	Familiar Plot with Some New Packaging Twists,	10-10-2013
A3LDLV1GWQJLEQ	B000IKQX44	eric talerico Greenmanwest	This is one of the more campy and fun SciFi shows to come from the BBC. It has some of the same arch sense of humor that makes the Dr. Who series so beguiling, but with a slightly darker and more dangerous edge.,	5	Campy and Fun SciFi,	11-02-2013
A23JS9UFZWZKH0	B000IKQX44	Mary	Well, I think this series would be great for mystery science theater review.  I like the campy quality of the series  but die hard scifi fans probably won't like it.

AIYEG9VA07EZS	B000IKQX44	Roger Heumann	A lot &#34;off the wall&#34;.First thing I noticed was the Alert response time (at the beginning) of nearly 10 minutes is TOTALLY wrong. (Seriously folks, it's under 60 seconds!!)  and to place the ONE GUY responsible (for the whole debacle) in a position of leadership!?! NOT HAPPENING!!! And there's not a way -- good or bad -- to 'spin' it.The story was very good, but what this series lacked was a director.,	3	And there's not a way -- good or bad -- to 'spin' it,	07-07-2014

A3LOEAFCDUA1W7	B000IO3OBK	Nate	Yul is a great Survivor and is the mastermind of the entire season and deserves to win. Jeff Probst declares he was disappointed that Ozzy didn't win because of how well he dominated all the challenges. Ozzy is one of the best players to ever play the game and his game is pure according to Yul. He doesn't screw anyone in his alliance over and physically is a step above anyone else in the game. Yul is much smarter than Ozzy and gets more respect from the other players. Jonathan Penner is pretty funny and owns Probst in some of the back and forth at challenges. In the start of the game the tribes are divided by ethnicities into 4 tribes, which has never happened in Survivor. After the Asians dominate the first 2 challenges the tribes are mixed up. The hidden immunity idol plays a big role in this season. It's pretty cheap that you get to play it after the votes are read, so the person with the idol never gets any votes. This is a great season of Survivor, you should buy it.,	5	3rd best season of Survivor,	04-05-2013

A1ZKTI37TXXR89	B000IVUL64	J3F	This season slowed down a little bit compared to season 4.  Intensity was there, but as the season progress, less chaos between episodes.  Opening was cool in Brazil.

It kinda looks like they are just putting something together to have a show on a couple of the episodes. That is my only negative.

This series is one of my favorites and I have just about all of the seasons.  I really like William Peterson so I am not sure I will buy any more once he leaves in season 8 or 9.  I find that when I watch them again I see something I missed the times before so it is well worth the money to be able to have control over what I watch and when I watch it.,	5	One of my favorites.,	07-05-2011

Honestly, I could do without the foul language and the nudity and in most cases such would cause me to go elsewhere. But this show is one of the BEST crime drama's I've ever seen. The main character, Dexter Morgan, is one of the BEST lead characters ever. The supporting cast of characters (everyone from his sister to girlfriend(s) to the many police officers) are all excellent as well. But wow...the story is soo good!

A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL	B000JO9JHW	Little Miss Cutey	Dexter is the most amazing, clever, funny, dark and thrilling program I've almost ever seen.  It is brilliant and unique and interesting and thoroughly enjoyable.  The fact that we can actually like a serial killer is amazing in itself.Michael C Hall is fantastic as Dexter.  He is intelligent, lost, and almost unable to feel love for another human.  The story lines are chilling and keep you on the edge of your seat - you are always guessing.  The writing is superb and witty and smart.  I never read Jeff Lindsays books, but now I think I'll go buy them and read cover to cover.Trust me; this show is one that grabs you and won't let go till the ride is over.  Just when you think you have things figured out, they might take a different turn.  It's addictive and one of the best programs you'll ever see.  It's great and I love this.,	5	To say this is brilliant is truly an understatement :-),	07-12-2008
A24KZBAAUTC83R	B000JO9JHW	Mace & Lacey Gannon	Showtime's creative and terrific series of DEXTER is so fresh and uber-cool that we just have to applaud everyone who works on this awesome cable TV series.It is so rare to watch a television show that rivals or even feels like you are reading a rich novel. Usually they screw it up, whether it be Hollywood big screen adaptations of the Sci-Fi channel - they all usually suck eggs.But not Showtime! They are currently way better than HBO. With the richness of feel and look at the miami-based Dexter, the actors and writers here truly shine above most others of all arenas of television and/or Box Office standards.And the 2nd season thus far is just as good - if not better!,	5	DEXTER is no Disaster!,	11-12-2007

A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y	B000JO9JHW	Monkdude	This is the leader of the pack in terms of Showtime's original series. This is the only show they have that I feel can compete with HBO. The acting and writing are amazing, especially Michael C. Hall (who got an Emmy and Screen Actors Guild nomination for this part).If you can handle the macabre, allow yourself to enter Dexter's world. You might find it hard to leave until the first season is over.,	5	Dark...Disturbing...Brilliant,	06-12-2007

Prior to his departure, Kavanaugh had been tasked by Captain Aceveco to find the dirt on Vic.  Hellbent and determined, Kavanaugh does his best to do so.I don't know whether it was his character, his acting or the side story, but I didn't like the introduction of Kavanaugh to the series.  Sure, I believe many think the introduction may have been needed, but the subplot was often way too distracting.,	4	Season 5 with Forest Whitaker,	04-04-2014

He goes after Lem and tries to get him to turn on the rest of the team. The main story is basically the team trying to keep Lem out of jail.

A281387UUS2IN5	B000LVIIUC	Beantown Jim	As a brand name, as a product, I trust South park to deliver entertainment quality more than any other.  the Simpsons were great at one time, but the tired series drags on, so DVD's of its latter years are as tired as its writing staff.  South Park on the other hand is as vibrant as it ever was.  The incredibly audacious creators of the series are the two most insolent creeps to ever blacken a studio.  However, funny is funny.  Moreover, whereas the Simpsons do not make many polical points (being in prime time on network tv), South Park makes few shows that do NOT have political points.  They skewer virtually everyone.  Who else would show Gene Siskel, the harmless affable film critic,and JFK, in hell?  They are at their best when WE are at our worst.  As we cower before threats from overseas, they did a brilliant piece about literally putting your head in the sand.,	5	What more can you say?,	09-12-2010

A3EDIPCXT15C3T	B000MMX5E4	Honey Solomon	Exceptionally well presented documentation of the pathway to Auschwitz (Poland). This presents the Nazi ideology from the inception of the T-3 euthanasia program for disposing of those (ethnic Germans) who were mentally ill or suffered from other medical problems to the extermination of all peoples considered 'unworthy of life' and prisoners of war. . .  Poles, Russians and Jews. From a small pre-war barracks for Polish soldiers, it follows the path to the mass slaughter house it became during WWII. Included are multiple aspects of the killing process and how it evolved. Original architectural designs, diaries and personal interviews with both the SS and survivors accompanied by original footage (Ukrainian) and psychological profiles offers an overview of all that became Auschwitz.Video and narrative are well suited for those who prefer not to be exposed to all the sensationalism and gore often found in so many of these documentaries.

A222DZLU5DIC14	B000MMX5E4	lilacsblooming	I knew about Auschwitz, of course...conceptually I knew what had been done there and I knew the horror of it.  I just didn't grasp the full depth of WHY, nor did I realize how things were done.  This documentary series is mind opening.  It uses recently discovered plans and recreates what things would have looked like, it interviews people who made it through, it tells the story of the countless people who did NOT make it through and it helps us see with even greater clarity that this kind of atrocity must never ever be allowed to occur again.,	5	Knowledge is power, knowing all there is to know about history is imperitive,	01-03-2014

A2PLQBS4SHFWC9	B000MMX5E4	Rudy	The subject matter is appalling in itself.  It is difficult to detach yourself emotionally from the horrors that were inflicted at Auschwitz.But, it is a BBC production and with that comes thorough, authoritative, accurate and objective presentation of the subject matter.It is worth watching as an historical document and not for entertainment, which it certainly is not!  I believe everyone should see this from the standpoint of understanding what a despotic and/or dictatorial regime can accomplish if left unchecked.  When one person can rule an entire nation by personal decree as opposed to a balanced law making process, then anything and everything is possible, even to declaring a portion of your own population to be a dangerous enemy.  There are lessons to be learned here.,	5	Five Stars for Quality,	02-12-2014

Suicide bombers hit the country on a regular basis, and no one is safe.  New President Wayne Palmer (D. B. Woodside) has arranged Jack's release from a Chinese prison camp.  Jack is to be traded to the terrorists in exchange for a promised cease fire.Jack agrees to give his life for the peace of his country.  But when he finds out that it was all a lie, he escapes to begin another cat and mouse hunt with the terrorists.  Only this time, they've already struck once, leading to a calamity.  Meanwhile, the trail leads Jack to his own family.  What secrets are his dad and brother hiding?  Can he stop the terrorists before they unleash even more terror on America?And more importantly, what happened to this once great show?  I've been a fan of this show since season one.

A29IFLFJ61H3W7	B000MPGI68	Phil Levin	Season 6 is OK but the novelty is wearing off.  Jack is superhuman, of course.  Supporting characters Morris & Cloe are interesting. The rest are basic carryovers.  We will see if the new (12 hour) 'Live another day' comes up with something new.  I have been working my way through from season one over the last few months.  Could be better with long breaks between seasons so you get ready for a fresh Jack Attack fix?  That's how I see it.  Have fun watching!,	3	Variations on an (old) theme,	05-09-2014

Jack finds out it's all for nothing and escapes to help save the day. Throughout this day, Jack teams up with terrorist who wants peace, there is an attack on President Wayne Palmer, the Vice President wants to bomb another country, Jack must find 5 suitcase nukes, stop his dad and brother, help his nephew, and a whole lot more! This is one of the better seasons. One of the characters I don't really like at first is Tom Lennox, then later in the day, I start to like him. Then, I don't really like Vice President Noah Daniels, but toward the end of the day, I kinda like him. If you love 24, and Jack Bauer, you'll love 24: DAY SIX!!!,	4	24: DAY SIX...,	08-07-2008

ABWHLZFEM5SZY	B000MVIAUY	R. Jensen	This season is basiclly the exact same as with the first season. Only differences are different characters, different creatures, a couple more story arches start recurring and a couple big story arches are resolved. This season also has the same flaws as the first, it seemed to posess a crazy amount of hot girls and some of the dialogue between Sam and Dean got repetitive. Still enjoyed the suspense, the laughs, the mythology and the action. A good viewing.,	5	Same as with the first season,	04-02-2014

A3L577V8TY26GN	B000MVN8GK	D. Jester	First, I love Veronica Mars. Cleverly written, generally well acted, good production values. Not to mention that Kristen Bell is a little doll! I would rank the first two seasons among my top 10-15 all time favorite shows. It started out strong in season 3 as well, but then began fading. By this time, several interesting characters were gone- Kendall Casablancas (Charisma Carpenter)and Aaron Echolls (Harry Hamlin)most important among them. Another problem with the third season is that there were too many threads left hanging and unexplained subplots, perhaps to have been picked up in the 4th season, which never materialized. I suspect that late in the 3rd season, cast, crew, and writers knew they were not to be picked up for another season, and everything started going downhill. If you haven't seen this series, you may be able to find some episodes online to see if you like it. I was poking around free TV sites (legal sites, paid for by advertising, of course)when I first found this series. But then if you...	3	3rd Season is not quite as good,	08-10-2011

How dumb are these TV execs to cancel a show without allowing an ending? I must see the movie when it comes out so I know how it ends. Kudos to Kristen Bell and the guy who plays her dad (can't pronounce or spell his name) and all the friends and boyfriends.

A1Z40REPQ04JKK	B000MVN8GK	dotla	While entertaining, this season seems more contrived than others.  The personal ties from earlier seasons added continuity to the episodes.

A1GP75BW2SIGW8	B000MVN8GK	Faithful Scott	I absolutely loved this show. I see it has been listed as a cult thing and I'm not sure what that means. I'm a very senior Senior so my interest may be surprising but I had a hard time doing anything else until I'd finished watching the last episode.

A2A6NH6DPE0VXR	B000MVN8GK	Jim Pimmy	This show is fresh and smart and always had clever idea for new cases and stories yet it was canceled ?? When Smallville which is sorta just dragging on these days is going on to it's 7th season. But hey at least that's way better than 7th Heaven which at least isn't coming back. Why can't the CW bring back Veronica if they could bring back the lame 7th Heaven after canceling it. I got into Veronica Mars the most this season, so it really bugs me that it got canceled. Hell I think everything was canceled but Smallville and Supernatural, so why would they have to cut this show too ? It was actually good even if Veronica could act just a little too much like an overly goofy version of Buffy. It was still a really good unpredictable teen detective show and beats a lot of the crap shows that actually weren't canceled this year!,	4	Super Pissed that it was canceled,	06-09-2007

Next to Firefly (another too soon canceled TV show), Veronica Mars is the best thing I've watched in a long time.  Highly recommended.

AI8ZXQ2LY3OO3	B000MVN8HE	A. Gaballa	Lots to chew on and enjoy whether you were already familiar with these characters or not.  Nice flow to the plotline.  I enjoyed it very much. The writer made her mother's addictive personality an unavoidable inheritance of Veronica's.  Will our heroine embrace this trait as a weakness that she will always fall prey to or will she find a way to make it a strength? This was the consistent psychological thread that deepened the murder mystery and gave the audience a super meaningful connection to Veronica Mars.  All of the characters from her childhood were grappling with a question: to what extent are we unable to throw off genetic proclivities and childhood traumas and other cultural influences in order to walk our own path in life?,	5	Excellent engaging story,	05-12-2014
A32A1BTJBLW7QX	B000MVN8HE	Cathy	This was a good story as follow up to the seasons of VM. I liked the story and was glad that many loose ends were tied up.

A380H0RPMMOG3E	B000MVN8HE	E. Von Ray adventurer	From the trailers, I had very low expectations. This film far exceeded those. I had to get used to the style of this movie in that Veronica narrated it, her texts would appear almost as 'bubbles' on the screen from time to time and there were a lot of characters I did not know from the tv series, which I have seen but a long time ago and didn't remember all of them. No matter. I quickly adapted to these and instead enjoyed the mystery.The film corrected one thing and this is a SPOILER. At the beginning of the film she is with a guy and they were an item but it was very clear to me they had no real chemistry. It was with Logan you instantly saw the chemistry. Well, enough said on that.Kristen Bell is outstanding in the lead and I liked everyone in this film.It is beautifully shot, too. I was very impressed with the overall look of the film. Someone called it 'low budget'? Don't believe it.

A6FWP1A03APPO	B000MVN8HE	James Attwood	It's been some time since the show ended, but the movie does a fine job of pretty much picking up right where the show left off. Many of the recurring characters from the television show have small appearances, but the focus of the movie rests squarely on Veronica and Logan. Like many of the episodes, the &#34;mystery&#34; is revealed in the closing moments in fairly quick order. The mystery, while important, is not the point of the story, the characters are. The mystery is simply the delivery vehicle.The pacing of the movie feels somewhat rushed, but that may simply be due to the number of acknowledgements of the original series that it tries to fit into a mere 100 minutes of movie time. These little glimpses of what has become of Veronica's past life are not entirely necessary. They are there for the fans. But since this was a fan-funded project, it's entirely understandable.One need not have any clue about Veronica Mars before seeing this film. It is capable of standing on its own. However, for those wa...	4	A fun reunion with old friends.,	06-10-2014

A3QLAOOTFEHCJI	B000MVN8HE	M. Oleson	I saw most, if not all, of the TV series when it was on.  I loved the show, Veronica's sass and the father-daughter relationship.  Having said that, I wasn't obsessed.  A little sad when it departed but I can say that about a lot of shows that leave too early for my liking.  Admittedly I was glad to get back together with the old crowd and I remembered most of the characters.Veronica (Kristen Bell), now involved with good-guy Piz (Chris Lowell) has recently graduated from law school and is on the verge of accepting a job with a prestigious NYC law firm.  But she's drawn back to richy-bitchy Neptune, CA when one-time bad-boy paramour Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring) is arrested for murdering his pop singer girlfriend.  Oh, and it's her 10th year high school reunion.  Against her better judgment, Veronica can't turn Logan down, presumably to help screen defense attorneys.  But it goes further as she digs deeper and deeper into the crime.Thanks to some fine dialog written by Rob Thomas (also directed) and Diane ...	4	Glad to have Veronica back,	04-08-2014

There isn't much of a story here, and it about equals the quality of the show it's based on.  That said, if you're a fan, you'll probably enjoy it and laugh harder than everyone else in the room.

A1DRV8ECC2FMFE	B000MVN8HE	urbantantra urbantantra	I love me some Veronica Mars!  No, the movie does not give you all the same joy, anticipation and frenzied excitement as the TV show but it was a well done story of people who have moved into the next stages of life with all the decisions, dramas and regrets that can come along for the ride.  Throw in murder, intrigue, and a love affair for the ages...and you have one heck of a movie.  if you like film noir, suspense, and detective movies, check it out.Also, when you do, you support a movement. I believe that if we get a Veronica Mars movie every few years, they will just get better and better because the creator is committed to such excellence and has the vision.  Let's support it and keep the dream alive.  This has been a PSA brought to you by this one fan of Veronica Mars.,	5	Witty, Loyal, Smart Detective,	06-01-2014
AJNIACIPB2I5P	B000N8M43U	Basementwatch Basement!	Point one: this is a very good psychological thriller, full of clever plotting and well played intrigue.Point two: This is part of a huge lifetime opus of Sidney Lumet's work that I am only beginning to savor and enjoy. Am I lucky or what?And the main point: Why isn't Beau Bridges in every movie all the time.Yes you love his brother Jeff. We all love Jeff. But the secret is if the two decided to have a charisma-off, Beau would just stand there and smile and he would win, hands down.I could watch three hours of Brau Bridges chuckling and grinning and lounging around with Robert Preston as the affable Dobbs and feel like it was time well spent. I'm transported back to a more civilized era.And the add James Mason casting shadows and angst everywhere and you've got yourself a show.And if you ever want to see that magic in action, this movie should be the first place you go.

ANCOMAI0I7LVG	B000OC2T4Y	Andrew Ellington	I've never been the type of person to get excited over television.  I like my sitcoms because they're easy to follow, even if you miss a week, and reruns barely ever get old (I think I've seen every episode of `Friends' twelve times over), but aside from that I really can't say that the idea of following a shows premise all season long interests me.  It's easy for me to miss a week and then find myself lost and wondering what is going on.  There are really just a few shows I've watched religiously; `The Sopranos' being one, another being the early seasons of `Nip/Tuck' (I lost faith after the disastrous third season).Well, you can add `The Riches' (as well as `Damages') to that short list.  As we head further into season two I feel compelled to write my review of the first season before too much blurs together.Like I said, following a show all season long seems like a daunting task for me.

It's so cool and addictive and I'm hooked now.Minnie Driver is fantastic as Dahlia Malloy who is part of a family of con artists.  She is on parole from having served time in prison for petty robbery and larceny.  Her and her husband Wayne are now on the move with their three kids.  They're travelling in an RV when they are witness to a car crash, and making a long story short, they end up assuming the identities of a wealthy family, the Riches, and move to an upscale neighborhood in Palm Beach Florida.  Wayne needs to find work to support the family's new lifestyle so his first scam begins when he tries for a job with his neighbor at his law firm.I can't tell you in words just how good this is.

A18758S1PUYIDT	B000OC2T4Y	Viva	The group in question is the Travelers--a band of con artists who have apparently been in the U.S. since the 19th century.  This show offers a glimpse into their world, and how odd and sometimes difficult it is for them to try to live among the rest of us.  Eddie Izzard and Minnie Driver do some pretty decent American accents as the husband and wife posing as the Riches.Complications ensue as they attempt to fill the deceased Riches' shoes, working, living, and going to school among the so-called Buffers (non Travelers).  Never a dull moment, as they say.,	5	Interesting look at a little-known group,	02-01-2009

As I said about &#34;Strangers With Candy&#34; I am not sure this series could be shown on TV these days because it isn't politically correct enough. Too many people have forgotten how to laugh at themselves any more.I have also heard that Sarah is kind of like she is in this series in real life in the sense that she is outspoken and sometimes people are offended by her honesty and political incorrectness.

A16QODENBJVUI1	B000OFME82	Robert Moore	It is impossible to watch this show without some kind of strong reaction.  There were times watching this show that I laughed as hard as I have laughed at anything I've seen in recent years.  But there were also times when I was simply appalled at how unfunny and in bad taste some parts were, as if the point had ceased being to make us laugh and had become to shock and dismay us.  There are many moments when I am simply blown away by the brilliance and originality of Silverman's comic vision and times when I wonder if she has any conception of what is funny and what is not.This is definitely not a show for everyone and it has nothing to do with how well one's sense of humor is developed.  There are simply a lot of absolutely terrible moments in these episodes to go along with some hysterically funny ones.  If you can filter out or ignore the bad and merely focus on the good, this is a show you will either partially enjoy or consider a masterpiece.

We are drawn in by being left guessing as to the nature of what has happened.This is where it wanders off the path.  The small town of Jericho is nothing more than a minature version of New York or LA from other movies.  with the exception of one or two &#34;farms,&#34; EVERYTHING ceases to exist at the town limits.  A character is either &#34;of the town&#34; or an &#34;outsider&#34; and that is it.It is plainly obvious that the writers have never spent any time in the real world, outside of a big city.  Rural America does not work like this.  Small towns blur.  The town limits rarely really limit the towns themselves and they often sort of blend into nearby communities and they really do encompass surrounding rural areas.

A1CQGAPQMN41LV	B000OJFV3S	A. Whitehead Werthead	England, 1519. King Henry VIII rules England and is beloved by his people. His wife, Queen Catherine of Aragon, is popular and the king's chancellor, Cardinal Wolsey, is able and formidable in administering the country and defeating plots against the throne. Another of Henry's advisors is Sir Thomas More, a man of great conscience and integrity whose respect and friendship the king values.However, it is a difficult time in Europe. The Lutheran heresy is raging unchecked in Germany and the Pope is unable to defeat it. King Francis I of France and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V are engaged in a deadly rivalry, both hoping to enlist England as an ally. With his queen - the Emperor's aunt - apparently unable to bear him a son, Henry also begins movements towards a divorce.

For instance, the writers throw in a couple of completely fabricated homosexual affairs, seemingly just for the hell of it. And a fabricated murder of a royal, married to the (historically) wrong princess. And some of the timelines are messed up. And the series starts with the murder of someone who wasn't murdered. And completely wrong on a suicide and someone going crazy.But, due to its contemporary feel, it succeeds in getting the viewer interested in this period of history, if nothing more than to check up on its accuracy.,	3	Fun, but not to be mistaken for actual history,	09-09-2009

A historical summary of past events leading up to what occurs in the series is most helpful, so I was somewhat lost as to who is who and who is doing what to who and why. That being said, this series is intriguing.,	4	Interesting Series. However...,	01-09-2012
A2L2HNYS5MD1BU	B000OJFV3S	Here in ocean city Melissa	Acting is perfect! Love history and almost perfectly accurate with history. I wish the tutors did not end with Henry VIII but continued with Henry's son and then Mary and Elisabeth. After all common?,	5	Love the tutors,	01-03-2014

A3K5ADG5TFUUBL	B000OJFV3S	Jennifer Jones Gomez	My best friend and I are addicted. A riveting show that will certainly grab your attention! For people who enjoy history and period time pieces, this is the perfect show for you. An amazing cast, an amazing attention to visual detail and a story line that just couldn't be made up! A small warning though.... it is NOT suitable for children.,	5	Amazing insight into the mind of Henry the VIII,	08-11-2013
AYIYDQVHCFUFU	B000OJFV3S	JesusChrysler Brian__Buffalo	This series is enormous in scope and devilishly all consuming. The characterizations and plots are astoundingly good and prove to be historically accurate in every vein.The acting is superb as are the cinematography, editing and presentation. I suffer no guilt at addicting myself to catching up on this splendid offering. I can say that there has not been one boring minute during the 20 episodes I've viewed.,	5	Monumental.

A1WTP99BOA0PGA	B000OJFV3S	J. Mullally booklover4ever00	While the series is very loosely based on the events of the life of Henry VIII the performances by JR Meyers, Sam Neill as Wolsey, and Jeremy Northam as Sir Thomas More really make the piece.Natalie Dormer is pitch perfect as Anne, even if we can see through her and her family and find her annoying! Maria Doyle Kennedy as the Queen is superb. She is warm, human, dignified and we actually feel sorry for all the king is throwing away for a woman who ultimately proved to not be worth it. And how much he will destroy in England in the process.Henry as a 'sleeping lion' is wonderfully portrayed. The series starts and ends looking like a 'bonkbuster' but there is a LOT of interesting stuff that will pique your interest in the real history if you can get past the nudie bits.Squishing his 2 sisters into the one who marries his friend Charles Brandon was silly and pointless, and it is amazing they never once mention Scotland in the whole 10 hours! Margaret Tudor married the king of scotland, Mary the old senior Kin...	5	Tons of historical inaccuracy, great period piece,	04-11-2009
A1S6E1LCH3RM1B	B000OJFV3S	J. Neal OSUJillyBean	Amazon's video-streaming is high-quality and the Tudors is no exception.  My husband and I love this show and while it's not 100% historically accurate, I've learned about English history a lot from watching.,	5	Loved the Tudors!,	09-04-2013
A2D49E9G59GANE	B000OJFV3S	Leila Lodencraft	There is probably nothing more that I like to watch than a costume drama, particularly one set at a time when men were swinging swords and showing off their legs in hose. A Man for All Seasons, Ben Hur, Elizabeth, Anne of a Thousand Days, Quo Vadis, Braveheart....I could go on and on, but you get the idea.The Tudors is a costume drama fan's dream come true. Sword fights, beheadings, lusty men and women rolling in the hay and in other places...beautiful actors, great music, all abound in The Tudors. While the history shown is not always accurate, it's close enough to get the point across, and you're just having so much fun watching the high drama, you really don't care if it isn't exactly dead on point accurate. It's right up there with Rome (which to my great sorrow was only on for two seasons) as a &#34;go to&#34; show to revisit when I want the thrill of seeing yesteryear as it probably never was.Sarah Bolger gives a fantastic performance as Princess Mary, Henry Cavill  is great eye candy and does a nice...	5	A TV Series that a I watch over and over again.,	06-12-2014

A1SWXIWBKI78QI	B000OJFV3S	MF	Modernized version, but well written and well acted. Lots of sex though, definitely not for kids to watch!

Whenever they get on a horse it reminds me of those cartoons when I was a kid where the character was out of sink - the horse goes down the rider goes up - a jarring tribute to those who were raised in the saddle. I'm sure that the 12 people that did not like my review live in their mother's basement and keep a bottle of liquid silicone and a box of Kleenex next to the remote.,	1	Yea, this and Romney will ingratiate us with our friends,	08-09-2012

A18758S1PUYIDT	B000OJFV3S	Viva	Casting could have been better here, as could some of the acting.  The music is nothing great either, and I don't care much for the fellow playing Henry.  The first season drags out all the business with Anne Boleyn, Catherine of Aragon, and Thomas Wolsey, also.The costumes and locations are wonderful, and there is some entertainment to be had.  Apparently the history is inaccurate, though I can't really comment on that since I am not that familiar with the era and people involved.Okay for a cheap rental, but nobody needs to purchase this.,	3	tolerable, but lots of missed potential,	01-08-2008

AX5ZFU92MGAZB	B000P56MYS	CVB	Like so many series do after a few years, Season 6 starts feeling too much. Granted the whole series is extremely intense but now I'm starting to be disillusioned with the many character and he episodes are becoming a bit choppy and sometimes meaningless. Still great acting and gritty drama, but it feels like a next to the last season for this series.,	4	Starting to get a little overdone,	06-05-2013
A3M4JJQ9NVCW45	B000P56MYS	Fire_Hawk59	At the time this show took you by the throat and shook you like a rabid dog. Others have followed now, but this show got people pto pay attention to what the &#34;real&#34; world is like and moved away from cliched, saccharine sweet, happy ending, sycophantic melodrama and brought us, kicking and screaming, into a new age of TV drama.If you havent wanted the series ....

A1PGC1GEBY9CZU	B000P56MYS	Happy Camper	With Season 6 we find Shane in a conundrum over happenings from Season 5.  To make matters worse, Shane and Vic are at odds.The writing is still tight but the camaraderie between the Strike Team is very, VERY loose.  In the end, Vic and Aceveda form an alliance that benefits each other -- for the time being.Even though at this point the series has run the gamut and is heading for an end, it is still 'must see' viewing.  Like a soap opera of life unfolding in front of your face, The Shield and Farmington Division are part of an effort for FX to provide very sharp work to the masses.Great job to those folks who were believers of the network before it had a chance to fold.,	4	Turncoats Amongst Us,	04-11-2014
A1F75QQEQ00OLD	B000P56MYS	nurse_judith	Season 6 is very intense and full of suspense.  This series has been excellent and season 6 is know exception.  It gets pretty gruesome with murder and mayhem being the norm.  This season is a real love/hate  relationship between all the favorite actors in the series because the plot begins to change and becomes thick with evil doings and secrets found out with revenge being the name of the game.,	5	Murder among friends,	04-07-2013

A3FPUZ4BWR4JC3	B000P56MYS	ThHobbes ThHobbes	The Shield - wherein it is proven that nothing elevates a TV drama to a place above daytime soaps more than graphic violence, profanity and gore combined with corrupt cops, grotesque pimps, ho's galore, violent mobsters of all ethnic varieties, rapes and pillage. Throw in a generous bunch of victims and perps, both repulsive and sympathetic, and you get an excellent drama that will satisfy all your voyeuristic needs. Good writing plus good acting plus good production values create a memorable series. If you can imagine Elmore Leonard and James Ellroy collaborating on The Wire and dropping it into the ethnic cauldron of Los Angeles, you'd get The Shield.,	5	Gore, greed, grime - what's not to like?!,	01-10-2014

You just want to be injected with another one, and another.  Then when they are all done you have to go through a withdrawal phase of disappointment that there aren't another 100 to go.Great fun, edge of your seat humor and drama combined.

A3IN2WR1OYWJTT	B000S9FEFY	Keri Teach Seaviewkat	This was one of my favorite TV shows to watch on TNT on Monday nights. What's best about The Closer are the characters we all love starting with Brenda Lee Johnson with that Georgia drawl, her flirtatious affair with FBI Fritz Howard and as ever the priority crimes team led by wise cracking senior detectives Flynn and Provinza. (I miss all those snappy one liners Provinza came up with on the Closer---the pair are more serious on the new Major Crimes...it's just not the same)Lt. Tao who is computer savvy and loves all the high tech stuff, Buzz who does all the crime scene video taping and prisoner interrogation's, Lt. Sanchez who always refers to his fellow officers as &#34;sir&#34;, and the rest of the crew. This was a top notch series, with great acting, well written snappy story lines, and was always very entertaining. I always loved the episodes when Brenda's parents visited and they always fit in Christmas episodes during the holiday season.

AL52QAT8MIRWJ	B000SXKBXU	Laney B	This movie is a reminder of what kindness, love, and patience can do for a family and a community. On the surface, It may seem to present a way of solving today's complex problems in simplistic terms. However, children who have been abandoned by the adults who were supposed to give them a sense of security and unconditional love need someone's patience, kindness, and love, as well as a sense of fairness or justice, just as much today as when this film was made. Each of the foster parents in this film demonstrated the qualities I mentioned, and then some. Good for them! And, watching the film reminded me that there is always more we can all do to help lift children above the harsh negatives of this world.,	4	Gentle Story,	01-09-2013

I have a couple of favorite episodes from Season 2. I like having the disks. Cable and internet service goes out from time to time, so it's nice to pop in the dvds and watch on my Sony portable. I was glad they ditched the funky potato foam of the 1st season package. This one holds the dvds correctly in place.

A16XRPF40679KG	B000U6I0B0	Michael Dobey	Eureka gets even better in it's second season, we get more of the fargo character and the stark character is still around. He goes in the third season and his presence is missed by many.  The show remained true to it's premise and it still does,  with lots of crazy science related disasters affecting people with usually sheriff Carter's quick thinking to get them out of the mess in some form or another.  Eureka is so engaging because it's a great place , filled with great characters and it's the kind of place that one would hope does exist somewhere in some form. The dvd's have deleted scenes and other features too. The picture quality is excellent and the series comes in a good case as far as I can tell.  This is a good family scifi show that can appeal to anyone who likes a great tv show. the only downside is that scy fy hadn't yet figured out that they should make more than 13 eps a season with this one. ( wharehouse 13 too). If it's your biggest hit then give us more of it!  which thankfully they do in...	5	eureka gets even better,	09-08-2010

A3OXHLG6DIBRW8	B000UERE3M	C. Hill CFH	This is an enjoyable Psych episode that pretty much follows the show's normal format of flashbacks and improbable coincidental occurrences, and it works well. We like Psych and tend to watch the older episodes on Netflix over theRoku 2 XS 1080p Streaming Player, but this episode wouldn't stream so we bought it on Amazon since it was the next in the series.No spoilers from me: This is a Christmas themed episode that has Gus and Shawn going to Christmas dinner at Gus' parents house where Shawn tries to impress Mr. and Mrs. Guster, but things don't go too well when a neighbor is found murdered.Sometimes the acting is a little over the top and often boarders on downright silly, but it is a very clever and fun show.Highly Recommended!CFH,	5	A Fun Episode - Highly Recommended,	11-02-2011

A2I6MHMAZZDCRX	B000ULTV4U	Mark Baker	Why mess with success?  That seems to be the idea behind this season of Monk.  And while it wasn't as strong as some of the other seasons have been, it was certain still fun.The season opens with Sarah Silverman reprising her role as Monk's biggest fan.  She hires Monk (Tony Shalhoub) to find out who is framing her dog for murder.  The catch?  The dog died before the murder took place.And there is more fun to be had.  Monk suspects Captain Stottlemeyer's (Ted Levine) new girlfriend of murder.  Natalie's (Traylor Howard) daughter Julie (Emmy Clarke) gets her first boyfriend and learns to drive.  Monk takes a job as a security guard at his bank to catch a robber.  And he must deal with the consequences of shooting Santa.

AER15RIMV8E6D	B000ULTV4U	Pumpkin Man	Monk's 6th is just as hilarious and entertaining as the previous seasons. Adrian Monk is still miserable and continues to help Captain Stottlemeyer and Disher with solving murders, with the help of his devoted Assistant, Natalie. Throughout this season, Monk must deal with his crazed fan, help a rapper, teaches Julie Teeger about love, hang out with his psychiatrist's son, shoots Santa Claus, joins a cult, becomes a fugitive, and finally has a new lead in the murder of Trudy. I highly recommend MONK: SEASON SIX!!!,	5	Another Awesome Season!!!,	12-05-2009
A18758S1PUYIDT	B000ULTV4U	Viva	What happened was this.....spoilers ahead.......Mr. Monk tore through the sixth season with stronger emotions, even beating up a guy who had something to do with Trudy's death. Dale the Whale returned to try to torment Monk, who had to fake his own death for a while.  Also, Julie Teeger got more screen time as she blossomed into a teenager, while Randy Disher was given more attention as well.  The captain continues to maintain a strong presence on the show, and so does Natalie.  Dr. Kroger holds his own.I missed Monk's brother Ambrose, though.,	5	Here's What Happened....,	08-07-2008

AKS9SJTHTU0OM	B000UU4IVM	K. Gordon	One of my favorite television series of all time along with 'The Wire'and 'Breaking Bad'.Like 'The Wire' this is a complex, Dickensian study of human nature,not afraid of asking big questions, and meticulously plotted like agreat novel, so that each episode is a chapter in a much larger whole.Just as 'The Wire' used the overly familiar clich&eacute;' world of the copshow to jump off from and shatter our preconceptions, and 'BattlestarGalactica' uses the sci-fi series, and the idea of human versus robotwars the same way.This is thinking person's sci fi, in the tradition of Arthur C. Clarke,or Isaac Asimov. It's about why we are how we are, what it means to bea human being, morality under constant pressure in times of war,fathers and sons, impossible loves, metaphors for modern and recentpolitics and real world situations.My wife, far from a sci-fi fan was hooked after 3 episodes, and we torethrough 5 years of shows in just a few days.

AHGT53AWMWCSR	B000UU4IVM	Stuart I. Riley	I purchased the entire seasons (1 - 4) and have found them both entertaining and worth the cost.  Over time, the re-watch high-lights the missing in-depth interactions of the characters, but also brings out details that might have been missed on the original broadcast.

A3LANSRXLT1PW0	B000UU4IX0	Atredes	I think the first two seasons are my favorites by far.  There are some excellent moments in Season three; however, I think it became more of a drama than what it had been in the previous two seasons.  Unlike Babylon 5, it is clear that Battlestar didn't have an overarching direction.  Great writing, but....,	3	Not my favorite season,	12-03-2012
A1FEITLECMZ6EW	B000UU4IX0	Jeffrey Thomas	Spoiler related wording (basically going around the spoilers, relating to them but not specifically stating what they are):This episode was amazing. The two part judging of Gaius Baltar was really good to. The revealing of 4 more Cylons out of the final five was amazing; especially when you find out who they are. It blew my mind to find out. Anyway, this episode, and the last one, have an intriguing element, the music, that is interesting and weird. I don't really understand why music, but it probably has some meaning. The build up in this series has been really great. This series is now in my top 5. I don't know where to put it. It's awesome. To anyone who hasn't seen this episode or the last one yet, don't skip these, these are very important and amazing episodes. You'll be blown away at the end of this episode, of that I assure you. Really, I do have to wonder who the fifth Cylon is. That's the question that will probably echo through the next season.

A3O3YL89M4R7W1	B000UU4IX0	P. Maloney Patrick	Firstly, I have never seen the show.  I love science fiction but usually only in the movies because I find a lot of the sci-fi shows on tv to be low budget with poor scripting and acting.This show however looks fantastic, if you didn't tell me it was a tv series I'd think it was a movie.  Aside from looking great the story looks to be engaging, exciting and just plain entertaining.  The whole point of this download is to get you into the show and to get you updated on what has happened so far, it does that well, I feel like I could just jump in and start watching the show.**A warning though, if you plan on buying/watching all of the old Battlestar Galactica episodes in the prior seasons I'd hold of on watching this as it will spoil it for you.**I recommend taking a look.  And while your at it take a look at the other free download, it's good too.  Here:SCI FI: Inside Battlestar Galactica,	4	The show looks good,	11-11-2007

A18758S1PUYIDT	B000UU4IX0	Viva	I didn't think it was possible to match or improve on the previous seasons of this fearless series, but then I watched season 3 on DVD.What's best about this show is that the writers and producers are not afraid to take on the tough issues of our times and reflect them back to us through the characters and storylines on BSG.This time, we follow several characters on story arcs which alter their lives forever.  There's Lee Adama and wife Dee, whom he married mainly to try to get over Kara Thrace.  Kara herself is revealed to be the daughter of a bitter, abusive mother.  Lee's complicated relationship with his father, William, is further strained to the breaking point during Baltar's trial.  In the meantime, Saul Tigh continues to drink himself into a stupor over having killed his beloved but traitorous wife, Ellen, and then discovers a horrifying truth about himself along with several colleagues.  The heretofore likeable Felix Gaeta turns out to have been in league with Baltar, to a degree, and then perjure...	5	More layers of complexity for characters and story this time around,	04-03-2008

A2Q4WJ3NPIVA8E	B000UVUMDO	J. Kennedy	&#34;Damages&#34; is what riveting television is all about.  The characters are rich and deep, their motivations mutli-faceted, their loyalties complex, ever-changing, or just non-existent.  Glenn Close is brilliant as Patty Hewes, portraying nuanced emotions with a deftness rarely seen on television.Season 1 focuses on a lawsuit against a &#34;pump and dump&#34; business owner named Arthur Frobisher (played surprisingly well by Ted Danson) who convinced his employees to empty their pensions and retirement plans into the company's stock before selling every last share he owned.  Acquitted in a criminal hearing, it's up to Patty Hewes and her firm (including the incomparable Rose Byrne as new associate Ellen Parsons) to make things right with the employees who've been left with nothing.It sounds very court-centric on the surface, but it isn't.  There's mystery, double-crosses, schemes, DIRTY LAWYERING!, and even murder.  The story is told creatively.  We see flashes of the present, but the majority of the n...	5	Brilliant!,	12-05-2013
A2DAHERP7HYJGO	B000UVUMDO	Mark Turner	One of the great things that the explosion in DVDs has given us is a chance to revisit television shows that we might not have had a chance to watch. It also gives us the chance to watch TV shows that are serial like and that we abandoned when we missed that all important episode. Such is the case with DAMAGES.This FX series follows a young beginning attorney named Ellen Parsons (Rose Byrne) who has just been hired by the most notable attorney around, Patty Hewes (Glenn Close). Patty is a no nonsense player who lives to win and will do nearly anything to make that happen. When Patty takes a case, more than likely her client will be the winner.At the moment, Hewes & Associates are involved in their biggest case yet, a class action suit against an unscrupulous CEO named Arthur Frobisher (Ted Danson) who sold out his stocks and left the employees of the company with nothing. While the government was unable to prove any wrongdoing, Patty and company are dead set on recouping the losses these people incurred fo...	4	DAMAGE CONTROL,	02-12-2008
A2QDPJRVXL7P4F	B000UVUMDO	Sahra Badou Bibliophile	This is a really great TV series and I really enjoyed the many twists that kept me guessing throughout the episodes--and guessing wrong most of the time. I've always wanted to be a lawyer, among many other professions, and I immediately picked up this series upon seeing it at the Duty Free shop at Heathrow International Airport.This series exposes the world of litigations, and how they operate.  The whole season is about a class action lawsuit targeting one of the wealthiest CEOs (Chief Executive Officer). When lawyers try to win at all cost, lives and fortunes are lost. Is it worth it all? Are lawyers angels or demons in disguise? How far would we go for money? Is money worth destroying the lives of others? Are secrets worth killing for? Would we kill for money? How much money is enough? What is the price of betrayal, and when is betrayal ethical? These are just a few of the questions you will be asking yourself as you go through this series.The way the series is structured is that it shifts between past ...	5	Self-interest, corruption, polititcs, and greed!,	07-06-2008

A1UOTG037037XY	B000V5Q8JQ	Cleo	Where is Calvin Klein tween's EMMY for her performance.  It is so great that David Carradine's daughter (echo!) gives an even better performance than her dad on Criminal Minds.  I've taped the last scene on my dvr a few times when the episode has reaired because her performance is SO satisfying but rewatching her earlier scenes is important to understand how devastating her character is.  She does crazy things with her face in her scene with VDO who is wearing one of his BEST suits and of course, John Glover is wonderful from his first scene when it is obvious what a burden his daughter's existence is to him but never more so than when he silently rubs his eyes in the interrogation room with the speaker is turned off - in one room, not the other.  There is a HINT of his character's resentment of his former protege that will be given the spotlight in his reappearance in a later season.

However, Vince letting himself go just makes me feel a little sad inside. &#34;Seasons change... people change... &#34; If only he had valued his hotness. :/Anyway, Eames continues to be awesome, but this is the season where Vince had a breakdown and they had to bring in some other cops. DUN DUN! I really don't like the episodes with Chris Noth and his little freckle-boy-woman. Whatever. Chris Noth is okay, but he's no Vincent D'Onofrio. Chasing his &#34;white whale,' Nicole Wallace, comes to a sickening conclusion.,	4	D'Onofrio is fatter in this season, but the writing is better,	09-06-2013

A1CQGAPQMN41LV	B000VU2SW2	A. Whitehead Werthead	Chuck Bartowski works for a huge electronics store in Los Angeles, Buy More, but is still annoyed at being framed for a misdemeanour he didn't commit which led to him getting thrown out of Stanford University several years earlier. Bryce Larkin, Chuck's former best friend and the guy who framed him, sends Chuck a mysterious email which causes him to pass out. When he wakes up, he discovers that he has downloaded the Intersect - the entire American secret database on international criminals, terrorists and other restricted subjects - into his brain. With the Intersect itself destroyed and Larkin dead, this means that the CIA and NSA need Chuck to help them defend American interests. Thus, he is forced into a double life of maintaining his working life at the Buy More whilst also helping CIA agent Sarah Walker and NSA agent John Casey fight international crime using his subliminal knowledge.Right from the start, Chuck puts its colours on the mast: this is going to be a show where the idea is to watch it and ...	4	Relentlessly enjoyable,	07-03-2011

The email contains current and past U.S. intelligence.  The email imprints all this data into Chuck's memory.  Soon after, Chuck meets Sara and falls head over heals for her.  It turns out, she is his handler, and charged with keeping him safe, and the information intact.  This is the story of how Chuck grows out of being just a Nerd Herder, to a real spy with the help of friends, family, the CIA, and Sara.  It's a story of nerds, love, action, and comedy.

AZAC7B4HD5ZVC	B000VU2SW2	Steven Herring	This show at first looked a bit laughable to me, but I assure you this is a well conceived series. All the actors have been chosen with great care, and they interact with one another as though they had been working with eachother their entire lives. They have great chemistry in every scene, it's like they're best friends in real life. The show has alot of comedy which is only broken up by action and dramatic story telling. What I love about the show is it's many references to movies, television, and video games. Chuck is not James Bond, not even close in fact. It is hilarious watching him try to fit into the world of espionage. He does have two bodyguards Sarah and Casey to protect him. Sarah is a beautiful blonde agent that is sent to be his girlfriend (lucky guy), and Casey is the heavy artillery side of the team. It's really fun to see Chucks and Sarah's relationship grow throughout the season. They clearly have great chemistry and that leads to some romantic moments.

Although he is awarded big bucks when he is freed, he goes back on the job.  He is not welcomed back.  I think this is probably true to life.  The acting is good.

AX5ZFU92MGAZB	B000VU4GW2	CVB	I never saw this promoted on TV and I wish it had been more popular so there were additional seasons. It's unique and funny. It is an unusual, almost unbelievable storyline but it unfolds in such a way that - if you stay with it - you become hooked. At least I did. I want to know more about why this cop ended up in prison, what's with him and his lawyer, his partner, his exwife and just about everyone else he knew and meets up with. Damien Lewis' character is definitely a contradiction. One of the things I don't like is the repetitive interviews with people about what they think of the cop going to jail. It's seldom new, they keep playing the same stuff over and over. That is a bit annoying. But the series and the actors are great. Adam Arkin has a quirky part, very similar to the character he played on Northern Exposure and equally effective.,	4	Wish it had been successful,	08-04-2013

A23YN4TXK5BCSF	B000VU4GW2	Linda H. Munday	I like the concept, actors are well cast and production values good.  Too bad there are only two seasons.  I can't wait to watch the next episode.  There is a new crime to solve plus the ongoing mystery of who is really guilty of the murders Mark (lead character, forgot his name) was sent to prison for.  I also like the bits of philosophy interjected throughout the show.,	4	Most intriguing show,	03-03-2014
A357LUSFAF6NJM	B000VU4GW2	Mandorallen	The pile of manure being the innumerable other cop shows out there that do the same exact thing. How on earth do all of them have viewership's? They don't deserve them. They are fairly unoriginal.Not so with Life. It is delightful. The style and such of the cinematography is sleek but unique, a hard combination to come by.The writing is so much fun. One minute deadly serious. One minute laugh out loud funny. And always sharp no matter what.Acting is incredible in every way. Story is fun.Watch this instead of those other shows that are simply boring and tired.,	5	Wow.

A1W71SSFRWYQFQ	B000VU4GW2	Mark Price Laborman	My wife and I had never heard of this series, but found it on Amazon Prime.  The male lead is recognizable from the hit cable series &#34;Homeland.&#34;  Yes, it's another cop detective drama and there's always a murder to solve.  But there are enough other quirky plot twists and the murders also have twists.  You find out right away that the male lead detective was himself framed and spent 12 years in prison for a murder he did not commit.  So these various parallel plots and plot twists keep it very interesting. The acting is good and there is also an element of humor.  So all in all, it is a very entertaining series that makes you want to keep watching it.,	5	First Rate with Fun Plot Twists,	02-08-2014
A3AT7TI6FXN6WM	B000VU4GW2	Norman Davis	The network that had &#34;Life&#34; must have kept it more secret and covered up than the Benghazi fiasco, which is why, without yet watching season 2, that they cancelled it prematurely.  I &#34;found&#34; &#34;Life&#34; backtracking from &#34;Fairly Legal&#34;, another secret show, staring Sarah Shahi... and what a surprise to find Damian Lewis was the actual star which interested me because of his staring work on &#34;Homeland&#34;.  So, seriously, I backtracked into Life from more current shows.  I ran into Fairly Legal on &#34;Cloo&#34; channel.  They had a &#34;marathon&#34; of Fairly Legal and I wasn't really paying attention at first and became more and more involved until I just loved that show.  I searched for it only to discover... as always, a wonderful little show had been tossed out just when it was really hitting its stride.  I've given up on &#34;networks&#34; being bright enough to keep quality shows so these days I skulk in the back roads of the internet searching for entertainment jewels...	4	Backtracking into Life,	08-09-2013
A2UO0MN92AQ4L3	B000VU4GW2	Old Timer Too	Life is one of those dramas that leaves you thinking about what you would do if you were in a similar situation. While the series was intended to go more than the two seasons available, it comes to a somewhat satisfactory close at the end of the season, but definitely wanting more. Damian Lewis is outstanding as Detective &#34;New Money&#34; working his way through cases facing the LAPD. Strongly recommended (both seasons).,	4	Above average production and writing make this a top-notch cop show with a twist.,	11-11-2013

When this became available through Amazon Prime, I rabidly devoured an episode...and then another...and then all of a sudden, Season 1 was over and I wondered at how deeply engrossed I became in Charlie's story and how much I had grown to care about him and his partner, Danni.  So now I was craving to know even more of Charlie Crews, et al. An excellent ensemble cast.  Damien Lewis is magnificent.  Now it on to season two.,	5	An excellent ensemble cast.

A18758S1PUYIDT	B000VU4GW2	Viva	The twist here is that detective Charlie Crews was put in jail for 12 years for a crime that he did not commit.  Imagine going through all  of that and then going back into the police force.  His wife has remarried, and some people still will not admit that he is innocent.  Add to this a partner who does not want to be with him, and you've got a man with some issues.  But he tries to handle them with Zen philosophy.  He also has a constant hankering for fresh fruit, since he never got any in prison.Damian Lewis is sympathetic and likeable as Crews, while Adam Arkin is in solid form as his roommate and former inmate-pal.  He helps to handle Crews' enormous settlement.A nice show with interesting characters. Fans of Deadwood will enjoy Robin Weigert in the role of the commander of the police officers.,	5	Nice little show about one man's life,	05-08-2009
A33LUPPKCBY906	B000VU4GW2	Wunder One Bruhaazul	After viewing Season One of Life, I immediately went back out on Amazon and purchased Season Two. Great intelligent entertainment - sometimes dark, sometimes funny, sometimes darkly funny.  Damian Lewis is the perfect Charlie.  And I've been an Adam Arkin fan since first seeing him on West Wing, so it was good to see him in a meatier role, one which gave room to show more of his fine talent.I'm stingy with stars, so four stars is very good, per my rating system.

However, I purchased the DVD set and then read the reviews.  I agree with some of the reviewers about the problem this series faced.  The comparison to the original, the lack of continuity, etc.  However, I feel this show is being way to harshyl judged.  While I can see the problems of this show, I feel that in time the kinks would have been worked out....there were only 8 episodes from what I can tell and find out and the chemistry between all the characters was spot on right out of the gate.  I feel it would have only got better.  The show was still finding its legs when the strike happened.  How long could this show have gone?  That is anyone's guess, but if the strike had not happened, I certainly think it would have continued for several years.  I personally enjoy seeing Sarah, she, to me, is much more colorful and 3 dimensional than the other characters....I just have to...	5	If  Watched Objectively........,	05-11-2008

But she wasn't, they weren't and it most certainly was not.  I also sincerely wish Hollywood would stop casting pretty over talented or even suitable for the part.

A2QWF2BJ2FM4R2	B000VU6K0I	Lovblad	This re-make of the classic series Bionic Woman is not as wretched as some would like to say. Overall it suffers from a slightly dull athmosphere, and it is true that the writing could have been tighter but the acting is rather good and the effects are first-rate even if they are somewhat in the background. So the story is quite simple, underachieving bartender Jamie Summers is almost killed during an accident and re-built by her experimental-surgeon boyfriend. Afterwards it is quite straightforward. But as I wrote it is not as bad as some other reviewers put it.,	3	Not that bad,	06-09-2008

AZAC7B4HD5ZVC	B000VU8DCQ	Steven Herring	We the fans were lucky to get this final season. The writers and actors knew this as well and pulled out all the stops for the end of this saga. I thought season four was good but a little lacking when compared to the previous seasons. This season however was excellent. The guest stars were impressive as always with Carrie Anne Moss, Mark Hammil, Bo Derek, and many others that made for a pop culture flashback. This season centered on Carmichael industries and how Chuck, Sarah, and Casey were on there own. Oh and also Morgan has the Intersect and Chuck does not. I was a little worried about how this would play out but the writers did an excellent job giving the storyline meaning and depth. I won't go into detail but it was an interesting ride with Morgan Grimes having the Intersect.Also Chuck and Sarah shared a lot of post marriage problems like starting a family and finding a house.

It has potential to really excel and become one of the best new dramas, but needs more time to develop. Unfortunately, the writers' strike may have a negative effect on the show's future.

AAZRWLML88IZK	B000W0A6AW	A kids review	After resisting the urge to make big changes in season three, season four changed everything, especially the team that works with House, which took a bit longer than it really needed, but which led to a two-part ending that's among the best episodes the show ever produced. The DVDs look and sound excellent, and the extras are a step up from the previous release, though they are missing a few of the more popular elements from previous sets. Unlike last season, this is a fine opportunity for new fans to jump on board, with a season that's practically self-contained, yet a wonderful continuation on the show's storylines.,	4	New faces, same old House,	08-11-2011

I've seen lower ratings posted for the later episodes of the series, but I think the whole series was consistently good from beginning to end, personally.

I really really don't like the way the last season ended.

A2QDPJRVXL7P4F	B000W4BJ7C	Sahra Badou Bibliophile	I enjoyed this third season more than the previous seasons. I found the acting and storyline much superior than previously. I like all the twists throughout the episodes, keeping one at the edge of his seat. Outguessing the plot can be difficult.  This season is also action packed, with every episode offering non-stop action. The way all the characters come together is also fascinating and remarkable, and their motives are unknown. Even the temporary break between Michael and Lincoln over the death of ****** (removed as not to spoil the story) was unexpected.The inmates inside Sona, the Panamanian prison from where Michael Scofield must escape, were very believable.  His escape attempts were well conceived and believable as well. The Panamanian landscape offered an exotic touch to the storyline, different from the maximum-security prison at Fox River.I really recommend this season, and can't wait for season four.,	5	Action-packed season!,	08-10-2008
A3DGB4HN3QCGAL	B000W4WD40	A. Burchfield	because, as one of the extra bits shows the storyline was starting to take a very dark turn. Another complaint I have is the introduction of several new characters, never to be heard from in following seasons. Claire Benet.'s flying boyfriend?, watch him here- he's not in 3rd season, no explanation. Wasn't the son of Ali Larter's character named Micah?, his Black relatives are introduced here, not one word about any of them next season.I have a feeling that if this season had gone full length the series might've had an even shorter run.,	3	The writers strike made this one as good as it is.&#8230;,	12-07-2012
A3OXHLG6DIBRW8	B000W4WD40	C. Hill CFH	Heroes Season 2 is not as good as Season 1 due to the writer's strike. It would have likely been the end of the show if they didn't move a head with Season 2, but the show did suffer some. There are a lot reviews for Heroes Season 2 that point out the many flaws and give spoilers, so I don't need to do that here. My only observation is that the some of characters acted completely... well out of character, and a lot of plot devices were used to move the weaker plot lines along. If Season 1 wasn't as good as it was, this Season would not have been so disapointing.Still all of that said, you need to watch Season 2 to get to Season 3, so recommended for the Heroes fan.,	3	Must Watch To Get From Season 1 To Season 3,	11-08-2008

With that the producers decided to cancel the rest of the season and try again next year.The cliffhanger from season 1 was not even delt with until most viewers stopped watching.Oh, this second season was PAINFUL to watch!  My co-workers dropped out after only 4 episodes. I recorded the show so that I could fast forward through, hoping it would get back on track.  It never did, I kept fast forwarding through the entire season.Season 1 was great, never to be equaled by season 2.  Maybe season 3 will be better, if anyone is still watching.

The best compliment a writer can get is that the stories are beleivable and unpredictable. This show is compliment rich. I'm not a fan of the big hair, y'all crowd but these are real people in real situations that are not overly dramatized. Each season does get better and as you know some characters are leaving the show, their exits are done realistically and without detachment. We started watching out of boredom and are now hooked.

A4PPZNQF1X2IY	B000W4Z5ZO	EugeSchu be-bop	I know everyone is whining around about the price for a shortened season, but let's face the facts, Season 4 was excellent even against tough expectations.  The humor was still buoyant and creative, and the storylines still had energy as the twists and turns stayed fresh.  Storylines were also craftily constructed to show parallels between characters, or wrapped together 2 or 3 seperate storylines, etc.After the slighest of let-downs in Season 3, Season 4 still shows the punch and zip of a fun and humorous mockumentary that's well edited.,	5	Excellent Season,	09-10-2008
A2QWF2BJ2FM4R2	B000W4Z6XK	Lovblad	This is an almost perfect comedy series. ALMOST.The writing is excellent, the ideas are good and Tina Fey is really excellent in the role of LIz Lemon, head comedy writer at NBC. However, and this was the case in the first season, the secondary characters are somewhat unrdeal and often unnerving and tend to distract from what could have been perfect. Teke the page Kenneth, he tends to be very often way too geeky for the good of the series. Also Alec Bladwin's character is way over the top and somewhat unrealistic (OK, it is a comedy series) but he has improved over Season 1. The problem is that Tina Fey plays the whole thing in a reaslistic comedy kind of way and the secondary characters are way too charicatural and unrealistic IMHO for it to gel completely. However overall it has improved over Season 1 and has a lot of promise fro the future.,	4	Not quite perfect...yet,	11-07-2008

AM0Q2JUS910ZQ	B000W5PIYQ	JEROME W MARTIN	I just finished this series and now am going into season 9.  I titled this season SOME LAUGHS; SOME TEARS because there is some added Castle type humor, some really weird episodes and then some really teary episodes.  I don't want to spill the proverbialbeans so I won't be specific but there is some changes here in the cast; one in particular who I have become very fond of.  Also asignificant death of one of the CSI persons. I was not particularly fond of this person, but he/she did not deserve what happened tothem.  Grissom finally falls for someone but after a serious murder attempt on her life, the relationship falters a bit.  There is a veryvile murderer who makes miniature models of the crime scenes even before the killings happen.  And the models are incrediblyaccurate.  I still haven't made up my mind if I like Cate Willows; sometimes she seems like she really hates men. sometimes not.But she appears arrogant in much of what she does.  And doesn't anyone in L.V. stay married?  While I love the show,...	5	SOME LAUGHS; SOME TEARS,	07-04-2014

A3LOEAFCDUA1W7	B000W5R3QC	Nate	This is the first season that James the gravedigger is in. He is great to root for because he's not a great talker and he's the biggest powerhouse to play the game. He ends up with 2 idols and makes a bad move. Amanda is one of the stronger girls to play the game but she gets pretty annoying because of how smug she is. Todd is the biggest schemer and deserves to win the game more than anyone else. This season has a big twist that screws the 2 strongest players in the game, Aaron and James. Courtney is probably the weakest player ever to play to game. She starts the game at 93 lbs and ends up at 86 lbs. Jean Robert is the token jerk. Peih Gee is supper annoying and freaks out all the time and she thinks she's somehow the leader of a tribe. James' tribe is great to root for and Peih Gee's tribe is the tribe you hope loses. Jaimee and Erik are both total losers who are great for each other.,	4	Decent season,	04-01-2013

The characters are solid, you either love or hate them,  The actors are all superb in their roles.If this series has not won a bunch of awards then something is wrong.,	5	Best series of tytpe ever,	05-04-2014
A1VK8EJ9DMTD23	B000WFB83Q	Jared Taylor	I love the intensity and controlled chaos this show delivers. The show is deep with the units assignments but also with the inner turmoil that each unit member goes through battling decisions of morality and ethics. The wives are in a similar dilemma facing their worst fears of losing their loved one, yet kept in the dark about what the husbands do and unable to speak about their husbands without endangering their lives, careers, and support from the Army who doesn't recognize the Unit in any official capacity. Great series!,	5	Gripping show about a Unit that doesn't exist,	05-09-2014
A272XB43SBQ2E4	B000WFB83Q	Karin Foglesong Moody	The first part of Season 2 got a bit repetitive and then the train suddenly picked up speed and left the station and it has continued to charge ahead all through season 3.

A2MD3U2HTTHTT4	B000WFB83Q	kbertch	I watched the show The Unit when it was television and then bought my husband the first two seasons on DVD.  I didn't know that it had continued until I watched it on Amazon Fire streaming video.  I liked it so much that my husband and I went back to the beginning of the series after we watched seasons 3 and 4.  Watch it and find out for yourself how good it is.,	5	Unit Review,	06-02-2014

I love the characters, the story line of both the mission and the home front.  I was truly involved in this season and each episode!,	5	I'm Hooked!,	04-07-2014
A3P36R9LOMW1CK	B000WFB83Q	RJK	The whole series was great. It showed how military teams work together and have each others back.  It also showed how the wives help and support  each other. I would recommend this series to anyone.,	5	Great Series,	04-05-2014
A2GLNCKCV8OH0N	B000WFB83Q	Robert A. Giunta HalfWalker	Great action in most episodes. Also, good suspense. Surprisingly, the patriotism displayed by these special ops guys is not overdone or offensive, and is very plausible. This season took on some difficult topics, like guilt over the many killings they are asked to do and PTSD that affects marriages and produces affairs. We see hidden agendas and conflict of interest in many episodes. Acting is pretty good too. The season finale was anticlimactic and a little disappointing to me.,	4	Good season.,	07-01-2014
A1QJ3GGNZ38ZAF	B000WFB83Q	Sandra Day	We love this show!  The acting is incredible and the storyline is very believable.  There are characters you love to hate (like Tiffy) and then there are characters you adore, and others who surprise you in varying episodes.  Scott Foley is so good - you never know what to think about him - whether he's sometimes careless or otherwise brilliant and shows his &#34;human&#34; side.  He is also very good at dropping in bouts of humor when they are very much needed.  I highly recommend this show!,	5	Each season gets better,	07-12-2014
A1A4GJRXR9RAHJ	B000WFB83Q	Sondra Kortebein	I enjoyed the unit, mostly the wives and the problems they had to go through.  Most of the things the guys did were so much alike except for some really good ones that you never knew were going to happen.,	4	The Unit,	06-02-2014

A16MILIILH2L0J	B000WFFAIA	Entertainment Aficionado	This is the most socking and disappointing of the Bones seasons. The short duration because of the writers strike (don&#8217;t they realize the effects of their strike ripple through the years to create animosity?). This caused some short cuts in the plot points of the season. One of the episodes from Season 2 appears in season 3 and it feels horribly out of place. The finally was very well done and leaves you on the edge of your seat!,	3	Good but the Writers Stike hurt it,	06-03-2013
A33PNAQ33DGBJG	B000WFFAIA	Michelle Polk	Another great season but a bit choppy. For some reason there were a couple of episodes mixed up or somthing. At the beginning Angela and Hodges were engaged but then in the middle of the season there is a couple of episodes where Hodges is trying to ask her to marry him.It was a bit confusing. THere is a episode about horses and humans running around pretending to be horses.It was rather disgusting. The best part about that episode is the last five minutes when the two main characters are discussing the days work.,	4	Bones 3,	02-08-2009

A1K7R1U4QZS3W2	B000WM9ZU2	Donna Dreamseeker	I have watched this series several times. A mix of colorful characters, with some humor from Dr. McKay played by Davd Hewlett and a handsome badass hero in the form of Colonel Shepherd, played by Joe Flannigan. These are the earth people. They travel through a Stargate to explore other worlds and pick up Tayla, a beautiful native of another planet and our first glimpse of the gorgeous hunk from Game of Thrones, Jason Mamoa who plays Ronan, from the planet Seteda. Adventure awaits as the explore other planets and learn of a formidable foe, the Wraith, who like to draw the life out of humans. Altogether a very entertaining ride.,	5	Adventures through the Stargate,	11-03-2013

Teyla is pregnant.  Great space battle scene.  Hot space nomad returns.  Oh, and Jewel Straite from Firefly is the new medical officer. . .hell yea.

A3573A5Y7U5AS4	B000WM9ZU2	L. Grant	I'm a Stargate fan since the original movie came out.  The original TV series SG-1 was a good one that lasted many seasons.  I checked this one out after watching the SG-1 series to the end.  This one has a different spin but a similar show (same creators).  I've enjoyed this one as well.,	5	Good show,	05-01-2013
A3V8B35WJ8YABI	B000WM9ZU2	LT	The cast works extremely well together.  The episodes are well written and directed.  There are comical, suspenseful, action, and drama focused episodes that bring out the different aspects of the characters and plot.,	5	Awesome season,	01-09-2014

AFV2584U13XP3	B000WM9ZU2	Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!)	While with the introduction of Sam Carter from Sg1 helps boost the fanbase and ratings for the series overall the series has reached a decent peak in its entertainment and sci-fi value for many sci-fan fans of this series and others.  While it came as no surprise it did feel a little unneeded to make a formal couple out Shepard and Teyla but oh well, also it's nice to see that the writers have allowed the side characters to have their own romantic relationships in the series too.  While we still have the Wraith and Replicators in the series they haven't seemed as much the viable threat they were made out to be in the previous seasons or series though they still are a threat.  The season shows the strong point of the series until the final season which sadly concludes this growing but sadly stumped series.,	5	Sam Carter Finally Takes Command,	10-03-2012

A3MDA891A1EPT8	B000WT7R6O	Chris Winchester mikeystoyz	This season was awesome.  If the DVD release is anything like the previous 2 it will be an awesome set.  The only thing I am upset with is the fact that there were only 16 parts of this season.  Petty, yeah, but hey, I can be petty.  The acting, writing, and episodes are pretty spot on.  As for Bella, I really dont think she will be in season 4.  Well, unless she can crawl.  All in all, a great show, great acting, great writing, just was missing to much for me to be totally happy.  I wanted more, not less!!!,	4	Not perfect but close.,	08-01-2008

A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y	B000WT7R6O	Monkdude	If it isn't, it's pretty darn close. Supernatural just gets better and better with each passing season. I just watched the third episode of season four last night on TV and it looks like the current season is heading in the right direction. This is the only great show the CW has ever produced. Most people make fun of the network, but I bet they haven't watched this show. It has good acting (the two leads are very likeable), clever and often funny writing, very good special effects, a classic rock soundtrack and a well thought out storyline. Not to mention all the different hot babes that pop up almost every week.Supernatural gets a lot of involvement from the writers and directors of the The X-Files and it shows in it's quality. If your a horror and action fan like me, you won't find any show on TV better than this. Okay, maybe Dexter, but that's more thriller than horror.,	5	The best horror series ever?,	10-04-2008
ABWHLZFEM5SZY	B000WT7R6O	R. Jensen	This season of Supernatural was fairly different from the others. While still carrying an episodic feel there was enough of all elements/characters recurring that it wasn't exactly the same as the first two. This season also started to mix in more light hearted hurmorous episodes among the darker and intense ones, which I didn't mind as I had grown to really like what humor had previously been shown.As for the additions of the female anti heroes, I actually grew to enjoy their presence on the show. Yes, they made the Winchesters look childish but that's actually how they have behaved previously, just no one called them out on it. Also it was pretty interesting to have demons be given more personality and learn that not all of them are completly evil and have motives.Despite that, I did find some flaws within the season. Sam and Deans arguments got even more repetitive, a couple characters from season 2 were written out of this season and the demon army didn't get mentioned that much, which was surprising a...	5	Different but good,	04-04-2014
A3IRBCCB3I5PPD	B000Y0S72O	Anastasia McPherson Bibliophile	I was late to the Stargate Party, watching them on amazon and dvd just as the series was ending, but the series has grown on me and become something of a favorite.This two part episode, which explores Sam's relationship with the Tokra/Goa'ould that briefly inhabited her is a strong episode with good plots that add to the larger arc that Stargate slowly builds over its many seasons of mostly stand-alone episdoes. A favorite.,	5	Part 1 of a Good Two Parter,	10-10-2012

A16QODENBJVUI1	B000Y0S72O	Robert Moore	There have over the years been a number of great shows that followed a good first season with a great second one, including THE X-FILES, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, and FARSCAPE.  There are a variety of reasons for this in each case.  With STARGATE, it is the increasingly complex storyline about the relations between various races and cultures with access to stargates.  Season One was basically your stargate-of-the-week format, each week an individual adventure with no real connections with any other episode.  This is the format usually preferred by network executives, since it allows new viewers to join a show without much background.  Serious fans, on the other hand, vastly prefer the complex storylines, where each week's episode does not stand on its own, but is embedded in an ongoing saga, almost like a chapter in a huge novel.  This has been and probably will continue to be an ongoing struggle between the creative talent and the network bureaucracy, though my own hope is that the success of shows like L...	5	Good first season is followed by a great second season,	06-04-2006
A1CQGAPQMN41LV	B000ZU1KMW	A. Whitehead Werthead	Season 4 starts with dealing with the fall-out from the S3 finale. Four regular characters discover they are Cylons, Starbuck has reappeared despite last being seen in a Viper exploding above a gas giant and the fleet, having undergone a mysterious power failure, is under attack by a colossal Cylon fleet. The opening episode gives us the most impressive space battle yet as the fleet sustains heavy losses as it tries to escape. It's not too much of a spoiler to reveal it does escape, but the victory is marred by discontent over Starbuck's return and her claim that she has been to Earth. Adama decides to trust her and gives her a ship and crew to see if they can locate the planet, but Starbuck's orders do not prove popular and soon she has a mutiny on her hands...Meanwhile, the Cylons are in turmoil with the revelation that the mysterious 'Final Five' models are in the human fleet, and it isn't long before the gulf between the models begun by events on New Caprica explodes into a fractious civil war.

A2ZT9K1PFBZ1L9	B000ZU1KMW	Gerald G.	To me, the story at times seemed stretched, thin and contrived. OK, so it is a fantasy, but the characters seemed to be doing things that wouldn't happed in their situation, things just to force a situation. Other times, I couldn't follow what was going on, like you had to have read the book to get it, but without the book. Overall, I enjoyed watching the whole series, though it could have been better.Would I recomend it? Depends on what day you ask me. It could go either way. Guess you have to watch it and see for yourself. If you are going to watch it, by all means start at the beginning or there's no chance you will understand what is going on.,	4	Battlestar Galactica Season 4 [HD],	01-03-2014

AKS9SJTHTU0OM	B000ZU1KMW	K. Gordon	One of my favorite television series of all time along with 'The Wire'and 'Breaking Bad'.Like 'The Wire' this is a complex, Dickensian study of human nature,not afraid of asking big questions, and meticulously plotted like agreat novel, so that each episode is a chapter in a much larger whole.Just as 'The Wire' used the overly familiar clich&eacute;' world of the copshow to jump off from and shatter our preconceptions, and 'BattlestarGalactica' uses the sci-fi series, and the idea of human versus robotwars the same way.This is thinking person's sci fi, in the tradition of Arthur C. Clarke,or Isaac Asimov. It's about why we are how we are, what it means to bea human being, morality under constant pressure in times of war,fathers and sons, impossible loves, metaphors for modern and recentpolitics and real world situations.My wife, far from a sci-fi fan was hooked after 3 episodes, and we torethrough 5 years of shows in just a few days.

AEYGX6L1KJQX	B0011NHCYM	D. R. M. wicmar	Unfortunately, most action/mystery/suspense shows that are popular these days take the form of grim police procedurals. I guess a lot of people like them, but my wife and I don't. The newspapers, news sites and TV news and reality in general provide enough grimness to fill our daily needs. That's why we've missed mystery shows with some humor, flair and even romance--shows like Remington Steele, Magnum PI, Moonlighting, Moon Over Miami, Buddy Faro, Seeing Things, the so-awful-it's-almost-good Acapulco HEAT etc. The only recent show that fits this bill that we follow regularly is Monk. So when I read a few encouraging reviews of Burn Notice (like Monk, on the USA Network) we checked it out via Netflix. Bingo! It has clever capers. Plenty of laughs. A wry, self-deprecating hero. A gorgeous but dangerous love interest. A semi-goofy sidekick. And the color and danger and tropical heat of Miami Beach. What's not to love?

A2I6MHMAZZDCRX	B0011NHCYM	Mark Baker	Michael Weston (Jeffrey Donovan) is a spy and very good at it.  Or at least he was.  One day, while in the middle of a covert mission, he is burned.  For us civilians, that means fired.  Barely managing to escape with his life, he passes out and wakes up in Miami with no money and no idea what happened.  Worse yet, Miami is him home town, and that means dealing with his Mother (Sharon Gless) who he hasn't seen in years.Michael is determined to figure out who did this to him and why so he can get back to work.  So while he slowly gathers pieces of that puzzle, he picks up odd jobs as a private investigator.  When he needs back up (which is often), he teams up with ex-IRA weapons smuggler (and ex-girlfriend) Fiona (Gabriella Anwar) and friend and former FBI agent (who is reporting on him to the FBI) Sam (Bruce Campbell).And together the three of them take on plenty of hard cases.  They deal with kidnapped sons, drug dealers, smugglers, arms dealers, and assassins.  Meanwhile, Michael is piecing together why ...	4	Getting Burned Isn't All Bad (For Us),	07-01-2008

A328S9RN3U5M68	B0012F6C72	Grady Harp	From the opening scenes of FIERCE PEOPLE (an interplay of tribal customs as photographed by the anthropologist father of the young narrator Finn Earl, demonstrating why this South American tribe of Ishkanani is so fierce) the direction of the film is nebulous: are we watching a dark comedy about comparing life in the New York streets to uncivilized peoples, or is this a message film of a more serious intent?  But as the story develops this fine line between entertainment and philosophical impact becomes increasingly clear.  Griffin Dunne's direction of Dirk Wittenborn's adaptation of his novel may be a bit careless at times as it strays from rational plot development, but in the end there is a strong enough final impact to patch up the holes he created.Our narrator Finn Earl (Anton Yelchin) lives with his coke-addicted masseuse/sexually obsessed mother Liz (Diane Lane) in New York, waiting for the summer when he is to join his anthropologist father on a field trip to South America (a father he knows only f...	4	'You think you're changing a tribe, until the tribe changes you',	02-10-2008

A16XRPF40679KG	B0012H0DBG	Michael Dobey	This show does feature great performances from it's lead actors. But the subject of depraved 40 something men who are drug addicts is not for everyone. Sadly too many of that generation are just as bad in the realm of parenting as the lead character is here. This is no heroic story but the symptom of a generation that helped to bring down society and is in this case this character is still at it! If you look at the character with disgust then you can laugh and realize that there are people out there just as bad as this guy is.  Still it's funny and if you look at it as what is wrong with things then you get It completely but if you think 40 year old men doing dope and such without any regard for anyone else is good then you are as bad as this admittedly charming lead character is.  The whole point is that in cali things are so low that any age of man acting this way is ok. It's a comedy but lets face it, this guy is a bad example of a dad, and person. Which is why this edgy show chose it's title.,	3	exploring the perverse world of cali.,	06-12-2013

Why did you do that, Amazon??  I thought the series was smart, sexy and fun and you obviously did that so consumers would buy the rest of the season.  Maybe it was because it was streaming for free but Californication wasn't great enough for me to justify paying $2 per episode when it was once free.

A3EUSH8DPW75LR	B0012QRPU4	barry	Here we have the first season of BREAKING BAD.  It is amazing to realize that it is only 7 episodes for the character, plot and drama development is so thorough and realistic another show would need at least double the episodes to achieve it.  The basic plot is a teacher who finds out he is dying of cancer and thru unexpected situations gets the opportunity to make a great deal of money thru manufacturing meth.  He does so to make money for his family to be able to live on after he dies.  But the show is about so much more than this.  Every character is addicted to something and the introduction into the dark world of drugs is terrifyingly realistic.  This is honestly one of the best shows ever to air on television.  It tells a story that may be too dark for some to handle but the superb acting, writing and directing make it all work.

A1ZR8F86DJRVLX	B0012QRPU4	Jason Bean	I'll have to admit, after seeing Mad Men (and just about everything HBO and Showtime had to offer) I was pretty much convinced that there was nothing else worth watching on TV..... happy to be proven wrong.You've probably heard all the hype surrounding Breaking Bad and know about it's premise (dying chemestry teacher becomes Meth dealer to support his family). While this sounded interesting,  I wasn't too impressed....that is until I actually saw the first episode.You already know about the great performances, dark humor (Walt-the main character going from timid to fearless) and gritty scenes of drug dealing, but what really sold me on this show was it's honesty. Not just the characters but of how their situations play out and how everything they do effects the world around them.If I had one problem with the show, it's that it's first season is so short. But honestly I'd rather have seven outstanding episodes than a handful of filler between them.This DVD set also has some great commentaries and interviews...	5	One of the best shows EVER.....,	03-07-2009

AZC562U18BK2S	B0012QRPU4	J. R. Trtek	By now there really isn't a whole lot more to be said here. Some people object to the subject matter or Walter White's moral choices, but then that's largely the point, isn't it? As I sit here waiting for the final season to unfold in another week, I look at the cover to the Season One set and think about the Walter White that was. To have managed such an evolution in the central character of a television program in the manner it was done is a remarkable feat -- unprecedented, really. There's a lot to object to here in a moral and ethical sense, but as a fictional meditation on the nature of those choices -- and that's in large part what fiction is about anyway -- Breaking Bad is hard to beat. Everything comes together so well: Acting, production, writing. This is one of the great works of the screen, big or small. Highly recommended.,	5	A True Landmark,	08-04-2013

Bryan Cranston is absolutely fearless as the cancer stricken high school chem teacher who has a lovely wife, a bright disabled son, and a daughter on the way.  He's also got a brother in law who is in law enforcement, and a talent for cooking meth that makes him a legend in Albuquerque.  Meth means money, and money means the best in chemo and other treatments.  Of course, it also means dangerous company, accidents and other physical dangers, and lots of pressure to produce more meth.minor spoiler below.....Cranston is also heartbreakingly good in the intervention scene, in which he at first lays out his case for not wanting to be sickened by the treatments...before he changes his mind.Very strong episodes.,	5	Stunning series.

It's not your typical zombie flick, per se. It's not your typical stripper flick either. It's not even a horror comedy. Yet, whatever it is, it is strangely a pretty good movie. The story has something to do a with a zombie-like virus passed along to a member of a military strike-team, who then escapes to a strip club where he bites Jenna Jameson, who the bites some more people.  Robert Englund plays a strip club owner who realizes that there's a lot of money to be made in zombie strippers - until everything goes wrong.Oddly enough, I still don't know what to say about it except to see this movie.

A6VXZ1EEPRTLV	B0013Z0PLA	trebe	Zombie Strippers (2008) is a horror comedy that as you might guess from the title, involves a number of women working as strippers who are transformed into zombies.  Reality is pretty much off the table early, as besides taking a few shots at George W. Bush, featuring half naked women getting violent, spilling blood, and engaging in some outrageous acts, is the main point of the film.Sometime in the future, a private company working with the government has developed a Chemo-virus that re-animates the dead, and turns them into relentless fighting machines.  A soldier infected by this formula while on a mission, winds up at a strip club where he attacks a dancer named Kat (Jenna Jameson), turning Rhino gentlemen's club's star attraction into a zombie, who covered in blood, becomes an even more popular performer.Club owner Ian Essko (Robert Englund) sees his staff of strippers gradually being transformed into infected homicidal zombies who murder his clientele, however he isn't too concerned, since profits ar...	3	step inside the Rhino gentlemen's club for a new kind of thrill...,	05-12-2012

A34D4KCP94ACJZ	B00150OTCE	K. Driscoll	The Orphanage or El orfanato is a horror film directed by Juan Antonio Bayona and produced by one of the most creative filmmakers around today, Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth,Hellboy).  I was just having a conversation with my brother the other day about horror films and how I often, unintentionally perhaps, rate them on a scale.  In other words, a four or five star horror film is probably not the same as a four or five star drama in most cases.  The Orphanage really is a four star movie because it is more than your typical horror fare.  Let's call it a supernatural thriller instead.  It was nominated for 14 Goya Awards and won seven.The film opens at an orphanage and we briefly see young Laura find out that she is leaving.  Years later and Laura decides to return by actually buying and living in the orphanage with her husband Carlos and her son Sim&oacute;n.

The Orphanage is similar in pace and scares to that film. It's often what you don't see that scares you the most. Belen Rueda who plays the mother delivers a very strong performance and really holds the movie together. Worth seeing in theaters, even though some people failed to realize it was going to have subtitles and walked out. Don't people find out a little about a film before shelling out $10.00 to see it?

A1K6K23WG0IBWE	B00150OTCE	Quadro Sinead Summer	I fully figured this film to be pretty much what I expected, which was another over rated supernatural thriller. Indeed within the first 30 minutes I was feeling like it might be just that. I found that portion of the film to be pretty average noting along the way the superb acting and production values. But the film quickly gets much more atmospheric and fills its canvas with an unusally creepy and melodramtaic tone. The story s suprisingly unique even if there were moments that seemed like they could have been inspired by films like Poltergiest or The Others. As a solidly moody supernatural story this film ranks as one of the better ones I have seen. And there is plenty of good creepy scares and horror along the way. The film gets more intense as it goes along. I found this film to sometimes be a soild performer as horror films go. It was often indeed very creepy and made me squirm more than once, I foud my self biting my nails, which is something I havent done in a good long time at the movies.

AUM3YMZ0YRJE0	B00150OTCE	Robert J. Crawford	If you want a new spin on a ghost story that avoids falling into a silly formula, you just may like this film.  It is heavy on atmospherics, has psychologically realistic characters, and you cannot guess where things will go.  I found it riveting and frightening, always wondering how it would turn out and did not at all anticipate how it was resolved.  Indeed, it is so original that I am sure I will watch it many times for nuance and the strength of the performances.The story is about a woman who wants to return to her orphanage and give to others what she received.  She has a beloved son with her, who sees playmates where there are none and disappears early on.  The mother in her turn tries to discover where he went.  As the film progresses, the viewer learns more and more about the woman and her past, which influences what she experiences in the present.  Her discovery and then her choice are brilliant yet different than at least I assumed they would be, as are her reasons.Recommended for all who enjoy a...	4	wonderfully creepy, mysterious, and full of the unexpected,	04-02-2014
A24K6KR7RHW7XB	B00150OTCE	Ron	This was on of the best if not the best movies that I've seen to come from Spain. Just about every element of this movie was crafted with loving hands that put the finishing touches on each and every scene before you and I would ever see it. The acting from Laura  played by (Rueda) was very good as her emotions changed from a loving mother to a panicked, distraught woman on the edge after the disappearance of her son Sim'on. The other case members also give good performances, but Rueda is the standout in this movie. The director worked magic with his cast and crew to bring this story to life from the beautiful orphanage remodeled into the families home. The cinematography was noting short of spectactular from inside the home to the beach and cave to the shots in town where the accident occurs. The mood was thick enough to cut with a knife and is so seldom seen in movies of this genre where mood can make or break a movie. The writer and director were able to turn words into this increadible work of visual a...	4	Orphanage Reunion,	08-04-2013
A1O626RCX1G3J0	B0015TFUSC	E. Saltbush	A bizarre but believable premise, puts these interesting slightly creepy characters on a course to what will probably be a total downfall.

A3LH77PBDFEO3F	B0015TFUSC	G. E. Williams Nunah	First, thank you to the folks at FX.Not only do you continue to deliver top notch programming for grown-ups, but you also make the seasons to work counterpoint to the other networks, allowing us to watch something other than reruns for more of the year.As season two begins, the moral dilemmas multiply and the plotlines are even more intriguing. Wayne, Dahlia and the two younger kids decide that they like being upper-class and decide to try and keep what they have despite the mounting risks.In another thread, the Travelers also begin to play into the plotline again. Oldest Malloy son Cael decides for good that the house at Eden Falls is stealing his soul, and opts to run away back to the Travelers, who have a new college educated (from prison via (University of Phoenix) spurting his mail order philosophies in order to take control of the clan).The new season is finding more moral and legal dilemma's for Wayne/Doug having to lie to his family and more issues with his less than bright adversary Dale.

The one downside is that they cancelled the show after only 20 episodes. Please bring back The Riches! :p,	5	Riches are Fun!,	05-10-2013
AVR7V60Q4ZR7C	B0015TFUSC	Scot Frink	As my review title goes, this was a great show.  Originally I thought it would be a comedy, but it's more of a drama with a lot of irony.  Not your typical formula show, which is why it was so cool but also probably why it got cancelled.  Very disappointed that they cancelled it halfway through the season (can anyone say &#34;Firefly&#34;?) with so many loose threads that will never be tied off.,	5	Great season; sorry it got cancelled early.,	05-12-2014

A2I6MHMAZZDCRX	B001ALX4I8	Mark Baker	Mary Shannon (Mary McCormack) is a Federal Marshal with the Witness Protection Program.  Working along side her partner Marshall Mann (Fred Weller), she helps witnesses adjust to their new life in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Since most of these people are criminals who agreed to testify against other criminals, that isn't always easy.  For example, there's the con artist who may or may not have set her sights on a new mark, yet gets her picture in the paper.  There's the man who brings his wife and mistress into the program only to decide it was time to break up with his mistress.  And even when the witnesses are innocent, their lack of desire to leave their old life behind them can lead to problems, too.If all that weren't enough, Mary's personal life is far from calm.  She is supporting her dead beat mother (Lesley Ann Warren) and her sister Brandi (Nichole Hiltz).  Not only has Brandi fallen for Mary's sometimes boyfriend Raphael (Cristian de la Fuente), but she is also hiding methamphetamine until her bo...	3	Not Up to USA's Normal Standards.

ALWB64XOXNMDP	B001BXQ95U	Picardfan007	If you like the genre of Super Heroes; you'll love the Flash.  John Wesley Shipp provides the lead character with a humanity, unlike his cartoon version.  This Flash is thoughtful, intelligent and has a sensitivity that other comic adaptations get wrong out of the gate.  The shows cleverly adapt the comics in a way a modern audience will enjoy.  The reason why it was canceled?  CBS didn't have much respect for the genre and kept switching it on different days.  It never found an audience because it never came on the same day each week. Football and other events kept delaying the broadcasts.  I believe it was done to get rid of the show.  Now you can enjoy them all.  I only wish it was allowed to survive.  It was a gem that will never be duplicated again. If you like the Batman, Superman TV shows with a modern twist, this is a show you'll like.

ALWB64XOXNMDP	B001CB8NQE	Picardfan007	Season five has fulfilled a lot of expectations  I had from the beginning.  While not tying everything in a neat package in the end, this one has loose ends.  Not enough to turn off those who stuck with the program for five seasons.  Rodney McKay, John Shepard and the rest, don't meet a terrible demise.  The show ends on a positive note. The evil Wraith, while not entirely finished, won't be bothering earth for some time.I recommend the program because it follows the tradition of SG-1 with a set of likable characters.  Woolsey, portrayed by Robert Picardo (of Star Trek Voyager ) does an incredible job as station captain.  It was good to see Colm Meany and the actor that portrayed the chief engineer on Enterprise in other roles.  I was glad to see Nicholas Pellegi (from the X-Files) in the role of a starship captain last all five seasons!What impressed me about this saga was the quality of the writing.

While the finale of the series could be call ambiguous it also left a decent ending that will still leave many fans of the series happy enough so there should be little disgruntlement felt by them.  This season saw the removal of Sam Carter as leader of Atlantis and the Representative of the IOA placed in charge though he isn't the puppet many expect him to be. Also we see a much stronger showing of some of the background characters which is appreciated especially since this is the final season I guess the writers and producers felt that those characters deserved that.  While we say goodbye to this sci-fi series which started weak but ended strong a sad farewell you can add this series to your other t.v. show dvd collection to watch again at your leisure and for the price very much worth it....,	5	While The Final Season It's Also The Best Season As Well,	10-04-2012

A1I1U2M5KSPY1R	B001CMQH5M	crosscountryman	That would be a better title for this doc.!  The tide of war, in all reality and truth turned against Germany when Hitler began to think he knew more than his Generals. It started in 39 when he failed to Invade England and waited on the worthless Goeing to win the Air War.  His hesitancy lost it again in Russia when he turned his Panzer Generals away from their original objectives.  Hitler was a megalomaniac whose fears were fueled by his use of drugs and his diseased brain to map out strategies that were doomed to fail.

A3EDIPCXT15C3T	B001CMQH5M	Honey Solomon	The video compilation reflects the original footage presented as 5 stars. Fascinating and horrifying . . . the absolute disregard for humankind  exhibited by the Nazi's is well documented. The Eastern Front presented not only a solution for the Jewish Question but for the extermination of those considered as 'unter menschhen.' Instead of hiding the facts, the Nazi indoctrination revels their  true purpose. There is the realization of what happened to prisoners of war and civilians alike. Only original footage can portray all the terrifying consequences to areas conquered by the Nazi war machine. Stalin's manner of treating German prisoners of war and even Russians taken prisoner by German forces is well documented. This series allows one to follow all the war atrocities as well as the sentiments of Stalin and Hitler. How to explain  the aberrant behavior can be found in recent genocide.

A3CSDBDV77Z0VI	B001CMQH5M	lily t.	Five stars for the original footage, which is spectacular. The narrator, who voiced Hal the Computer in 2001 , A Space Odyssey, sounds like a wartime newsreel commentator, which is fitting, I suppose, given the material. The script, however, is only informative if one has never heard of Operation Barbarossa or knows nothing about the Russian Front. Additionally the prose is really purple, since the writer seems to think it enhances the dramatic content to repeat words. Eg: It was a drive that was relentless. Relentless. RELENTLESS. But the worst part of it was the dissonant score- imagine Nora the piano playing cat, only without the cute fluffiness. At the end of both volumes the endless pinging of the piano keys was relentless, Relentless, RELENTLESS.  Recommended with the sound off.,	3	outstanding footage,	09-09-2013

Season Two moved all characters forward in their personal growth and development, although I would have liked to seen more detail about the Bailey Chase character.The plot effectively weaves a vivid web of real life events into profound change for Grace. The final scene between two tortured souls; one straining against unfathomable psychological and physical pain and leather execution bonds in full-fledged  terror, the other, paralyzed into submission by the greatest love and the fear of something soft and all accepting.The eyes of Grace embrace and beckon Leon, soul to soul into the last seconds of his life. Quietly, with large Angelic eyes and a yielding voice,  and the infinite truth she beckons &#34;Look at me.&#34;  She repeats. &#34;Look at me&#34;.Grace is saved when the choice is made to comfort Leon as he passes before her eyes.

Just like in law enforcement you have to have it to take down felons.&#34; We also have x cops  in the family who agree and I went up for the job of police officer in San bernadino, Ca. and was funked out because I only weighted 140 lbs.

The scene is set on earth in a small science town populated mostly by scientific geniuses. They live relatively normal lives compared to lots of other science fiction, and that is part of the appeal. Elements of romance are woven into the stories, comic relief at times.  Wish someone would decide to reactivate the series with a Eureka Two series.,	5	Great!,	02-10-2014
A2WH2DZQHBBAWE	B001DD9QDK	Onthepedals	We really enjoyed Eureka. Has all the right ingredients for our type of Sci - Fi..comedy and drama with some thought provoking ideas thrown in. It's ashamed this series was cancelled while lesser shows survive.,	5	Fun Show.....,	11-12-2013
A2VI2VOWSMYSNV	B001DD9QDK	Robert Bowen	Great show.  Great acting.  Great scenarios and story lines.  Always a lot of fun.  Will be sorry when I'm at the end of the series.  Luckily still have a a couple seasons left.,	5	Great Show!!  Come and Enjoy!!,	12-03-2013
A1VMZ0EK5YH02T	B001DD9QDK	Travis Anderson	Great show absolutely love this series I hope it continues to stay this good. I would love for this show to stay on for years to come.,	5	Eureka is awesome.,	08-04-2013
A109ME7C09HM2M	B001ENLHX6	Douglas W. Fielder	This series just keeps getting better and better, love the characters and the situational comedies, the cast has a great sense of timing and the writers are keeping it fresh.....,	5	Better and Better....,	05-01-2014
ALLV1OUJL3WN6	B001ENNJSC	Chad A. Barts Chadillac	season 4 has some of the most outrageous and downright hilarious story lines. This show never gets old and I highly recommend it to anyone who needs a good laugh. I own seasons 1-7 and i can always go back, watch them, and stilllaugh like I never saw them before.,	5	Classic episodes,	12-03-2012
A9W4HRJ4P6G5A	B001ENNJSC	XbroknlegsX	I bought this season used and the second disc was actually the 2nd disc from season 5, not season 4. So, in other words the wrong disc was in the case. SUCKS!! Plus, the discs skip sometimes. So badly it'll freeze up and you'll have to either fast forward or totally skip the episode. Pissed me off!!! I gave this 2 stars based off of that, not because of the quality of the show.,	1	Love this show,	04-07-2013
A109ME7C09HM2M	B001ENOB8Y	Douglas W. Fielder	I loved this series, I remember when it first started and my daughter was hooked on it, I didn't think I would like it.  Then it came to Amazon Prime and I fell in love with it.....okay lots of holes in the plot and lots of issues with logic, but it is still a good watch.,	5	Loved the series, hated the end.....,	04-09-2013
A34D06JL7LC6MU	B001ENOB8Y	Joshua Miller Josh	The Fox series Prison Break debuted in 2005 and had a first season that was intelligently written, intelligently executed, and endlessly exciting. The series miraculously had two more seasons (with season three being cut short due to the writer's strike) and Fox announced the fourth season would be the final season. I absolutely love this show, but the idea to end it was a good one. Prison Break was a one-season concept that made two seasons work but just got more and more ludicrous as it went on, while never failing to be entertaining. With that said, the fourth season is very entertaining. It's this season that the writer's throw all logic out the window. Character's who were dead return, character's who were forgotten come out of nowhere; the writer's of this season seem to have had one rule for writing; if it can go wrong (no matter how implausible), make sure it does.We've followed these character's as they escaped from prison (season one), ran from the law (season 2), and had to escape from another p...	4	An Exciting, Anything-Goes Final Season,	11-09-2009
A1ATHDILELXROF	B001ENOB8Y	Renee L Williams	I was sadly disappointed with this ending.  Not because it wasn't good.  Michael finally caught a break and then the series ends!  i think it was pretty crappy of the producers to put the last years of Michael's life on a separate DVD.  It think it was just a gimic to push us to buy a two hour DVD that cost as much a the whole 4th season.  I loved the series and wish there was more!,	4	Damn, it's the last one!!!,	04-04-2014
A21GDMT9JN2A5Y	B001ENOB8Y	Wayward Traveller WaywardT	But I still love this show, it was one of my favorites when it was originally on the air.Something about prison shows I have always enjoyed them.They had a good cast, and a good back story to work on.If I hadn't been watching here on Amazon I never would have known there was a &#34;Final Break&#34; then I had never seen.Of course they don't include that in Prime, but I did go out and find a copy.,	5	Fourth season is not quite as good as the rest,	04-09-2013
A1ITC02ET70N89	B001ENS0BS	Bruce Bruce	So at the end of the last show, we find out Crab-man Darnel (the black guy) isn't Earl Jr.'s father.  Then the show gets cancelled (I guess).  Maybe they just quit making the show because no writer could figure out how to continue.  Anyway, I watched every episode.  It was ok.,	4	Wow, was that the last show?,	04-09-2012
A331OF34UX4Y1K	B001ENS0BS	M. Fonseca carmarthen	Season Four is a great return to form.What mesmerizes me is, even today, we can have a TV show without ending! Can can this be possible? If NBC did not want another season, they should warn the producers BEFORE they shot Season Four! This kind of attitude help us to never forget the obvious: the ratings are Gods. TV executives simply don't care about the quality or boldness of a show (in that sense, it was real miracle that Seinfeld survived its first season - not because it was bad, but because the ratings were very weak).We followed Earl for four seasons. We wanted to see the final destinies of the list, of Crabman, of Joy, Randy and all the fascinating recurring characters. But no, that was not to be. NBC killed it, and killed it without mercy.But why was that? I think that's because rating fell during Season Three, which was by far the worst, to the point that, in some episodes, I was wishing then to END, instead of whising they did not end, if you kown what I mean. But it was not crap by any standards...	4	They paid the price for Season Three... NBC is cruel!,	11-11-2009
A1F18K8S6MFJA7	B001ENS0BS	Tim	Very funny. Don't understand why no longer on. Got better as seasons went on.  Remember carma will get ya. She can be a B, If you know what I mean,	5	Carman will get you and she can be a B,	04-01-2013
A1JR65ST3K320A	B001ENSOVO	Ed Joines	I started watching reruns of this show. I got hooked on it and had to add it to my small collection.,	5	I love this series,	12-04-2012
A16MILIILH2L0J	B001ENSOVO	Entertainment Aficionado	Season four feels almost like a reboot to the franchise. New cast members, new locations, very interesting stories, and even an alternate reality makes an appearance. I think this is my favorite season of Bones. Thank you to the writers, directors, actors and everyone else who made season four possible!,	5	Best Season IMO,	06-03-2013
A2Y1XWWGJHEOHQ	B001ENSOVO	Jacqueline A. Conney-forero jaqtwo	Pretty much the same show so if you liked the other 3 seasons than you will like this season as well,	5	bones good,	12-10-2012
A7KC71KE9RR5G	B001ENSOVO	justnora	As always Bones delivers intrigue and suspense. The dynamics of the cast makes this show work as no others and the characters are so believable in their roles that they just &#34;must&#34; be those people off camera! I love this show and hope that it runs forever.,	5	Intrigueing,	12-05-2013
AUWMFKLND0I2Y	B001ENSOVO	K. Marlow Kat	I am a very loyal fan of this series I love the humor of watching someone with out emotions try to be normal around highly emotional people and situations plus the gore is great,	5	Bones:Season Four,	10-08-2009
A2QWF2BJ2FM4R2	B001ENSOVO	Lovblad	This remains one of the better series around despite a slowing down in the imagination of the screen-writers.While it was probably a good thing to get rid of Zack, since his character was one of the mroe unbelievable ones in the series, the producers have chosen to have s string of replacements go in for each episoed instead. This is inetersting but tends to slightly destablise the series since some are good and some are bad.Overall the series remains very good, the production values have been strengthened and Booth and Bones remain extremely enjoyable characters with a lot of funny interaction and tension between them.Maybe overall the stories themselves should improive somewhat because they tend to be repetitive investigations with simply an added gore element to freak us out. Which is OK I agree but it is a cheap way to grab our attention.We discover Booth's brother who comes into the series and causes his big brother some initial grief so that is at least a wellcome addition.It is still verzy strong, v...	4	Still quite good,	11-06-2009
A2S60IRASI2XBT	B001ENSOVO	Lynn	You can really see by now that Booth and Brennan are made for each other. They can't help but get together real soon. The episodes are so good you get addicted!,	5	Bones Season 4,	08-04-2013
A2H7G79N25GSB1	B001ENSOVO	Nat	The only way I can keep up with the show is to get the seasons. I work overseas and am able to keep up this way.,	5	Bones,	07-07-2010
AR6MI6AVH9YML	B001ENSOVO	V Johnson	Here in this season we really got some weird cases but the characters were developing even more.  You got to learn more about their backgrounds before they all got together.,	5	Some weird cases,	01-07-2014
A3DGB4HN3QCGAL	B001EUE6X2	A. Burchfield	By third season I think that I was just along for the ride, Heroes always &#34;looked&#34; good but always fell short of its potential, at least this one rises above what Season Two was turning itself into. If you like scifi / fantasy you can find some good bits here, but the &#34;bargain bin&#34; might still be the way to go. My set advertises &#34;over 20 hours of bonus features&#34;- that would be the best reason to watch this season ( and even that doesn't explain dropping so many second season characters like Claire's flying boyfriend).,	3	Pretty to look at,	01-01-2013
A3RR4W7A8GWHC6	B001EUE6X2	Bandaid12	family love to sit down and watch this together. Love Hiro! Kids really enjoy the show as well as us adults!,	5	Family oriented!!,	11-03-2013
APOGXH3A74CM3	B001EUE6X2	Damian P. Gadal	After a short Season Two due to the writer's strike, Season Three comes back with a vengeance.  Back are all the twists and turns of the story, and all the characters that made the show so interesting to begin with.  Good and bad seem to switch sides, and there are lots of unpredictable turns of events.  Season Three proved to be a wild ride.  On to Season Four.,	4	More like it,	09-12-2010
A1FEITLECMZ6EW	B001EUE6X2	Jeffrey Thomas	This was a good episode. However, there are some things that just aren't fitting with everything.The first is how Mohinder is now. He couldn't hurt anyone and he suddenly changes to the attitude he has now. Unless the syrum did something to his brain this just doesn't seem like Mohinder.Second (Spoiler), seeing Hero kill Ando the way he did really didn't seem like something Hiro would do. I mean, he is told that the only way to join with the other people is to kill Ando and he doesn't back off or use any excuse. He just kills Ando. Yeah, he gets teary eyed, but still, this just doesn't seem right. Honestly, I think people needed to think harder on how to play that scene out. Unless Hero goes back in time to save Ando, doing it the way they did it is stupid. Maybe some of you guys think the same thing.Anyways, this episode was good. I give it four stars. Hopefully, we won't see a whole lot of mistakes, like we've been seeing, in future episodes.Edit: I take back what I said about Hiro, you'll see why.,	4	Great Episode, Some Issues,	09-02-2012
A3PGZPDXLW87XS	B001EUE6X2	Jim	Who is on who's team?  It is kind of like some reality show, where everyone is creating alliances.  A Fantastic view of history,  what happened in the beginning that we did not know about, and it makes more sense now.  Great so far,  can not wait to see more.,	5	Another great season so far,	06-02-2014
A2A6NH6DPE0VXR	B001EUE6X2	Jim Pimmy	Some Spoilers:  Heroes season 3 stuffs so much in one season that it felt like 2 seasons in one. The first half was better though. How Sylar was used in the first half was brilliant. While the season could have used more of Robert Forster (Jackie Brown) in the 2nd half and he should have been in the series longer. He was fantastic as the Petrali father who wasn't really dead. He's evil and can steal powers by just touching people with abilities. He has a plan to give humans powers and is trying to have a drug created that can do that.I didn't like how key characters lost their powers though. The season would have been better if Hiro and Peter had there's for example. I like Peter more when he's just as powerful as Sylar. The 2nd half was good and had it's moments but even the season finale wasn't as good as it could have been. It was a brain twister but not even one that made sense, since Claire's blood could have just been used or Sylar's. That's all I'll say about that. But it does make you at least inte...	4	It was better in the first half,	05-08-2009

A3QJL5A1Q03FF8	B001EXRQQ8	Amazon Customer	Damien Lewis and Sarah Shahi are two excellent actors and do a great job in a really written series.  Each episode has a self-contained story within a broader story arc over the full season.  My wife loved the series as well.,	5	Two Excellent Actors in a Well Written Series,	03-02-2013
A3DLB6IGRBQRRC	B001EXRQQ8	Amazon Customer	I really wish there was another season to get started on now.  I don't know what I'll watch that I'll enjoy as much as I enjoyed life.  it had everything--suspense, drama, humor, intrigue, love.  I just stumbled upon it looking for anything different because I had started getting bored with the &#34;free&#34; stuff.  This was a really good pick.,	5	Loved It,	05-07-2014
A3AE6QO7ZBEBPT	B001EXRQQ8	Brian batfan	Great show. The second season was digging deeper into Charlie's enemies and it was just so compelling.  Side stories were getting good.  All the actors are top notch and on their game.  I wish NBC would have renewed it or another network would have picked it up.,	5	Why did this show end?!?,	09-09-2013
AM8NF53VKNB3H	B001EXRQQ8	Cat	At first I only watched oh, maybe 1/2 a show thinking hmmm I don't know..then I went back and did the whole show and reallygot into the main character mind you it's not the usual cop show which is a wonderful departure..the writing is inventive and quirky which makes it interesting. The stories are basically stories about cops and bad guys but the way they are treated keeps me coming back and I find that I will miss it as it only went 2 seasons. They can't seem to stand good shows in Hollywood. There aremany shades of grey in this series and if you are tired of the same ol same ol' give this a spin but it's the sticking with it that willreward you.,	5	Interesting!,	07-06-2014

AG55C6IERCDAZ	B001EXRQQ8	DMZE Eric	A quirky police mystery show with appealing characters. A wronged police officer returned to the force after 12 years in prison for a brutal crime he did not commit.

AF8XDIFKEVP6I	B001EXRQQ8	Dr. W. C. Wiseley words-music-images	Great show, good acting, realistic yet edgy, but the best part from my point of view was the plot twists and premise of the story.  Wish there were more.,	5	I just love the scenario,	03-01-2014

A1VTIQMM5L2ZK9	B001EXRQQ8	Grandma	this is a cute, odd and light show for me anyway. I will watch it when I am tired of the intensity of other &#34;murder&#34;mystery shows.

A3LG4Z2EAE3BO2	B001EXRQQ8	Jo Ann Massaro	I stumbled upon this series and am now a huge fan. The main character is an odd ball who has figured out how to survive the hand he was dealt.

A1WNQPTOEREH91	B001EXRQQ8	Justicried	This was a great series & they did a good job of wrapping the story up by the end of season 2.  I still wish they had added a few more seasons.  All of the actors did a great job and the humor helped endear the characters to me.  You are never quite sure what Charlie is thinking or hiding under his ultra calm demeanor.  It is a fun watch to find out.,	5	This was a great series & they did a good job of wrapping ...,	07-10-2014
ASSP0WDQ8CCVT	B001EXRQQ8	k9krzy	Really enjoyed Season 1 and that's why I purchased season 2 - but the roles became a bit too quirky and totally unreal and I did not like that Detective Reese was replaced - did not like the chemistry between them.I have one last episode to watch and am not rushing to watch it.

A23YN4TXK5BCSF	B001EXRQQ8	Linda H. Munday	My husband and I really enjoy this show.  We like the mystery they solve, the many twists and turns in the plot, even the humor.  The lead character is quirky and even believable considering he survived 12 years in prison as a convicted cop.  His search for the &#34;real&#34; killers of the crime he was convicted for is very convoluted and involves his partner's father.  The production quality is very good.  Even though it is a crime show  (murder) , we don't feel depressed after watching.  It doesn't dwell on the gory.  I recommend this show.  Wish there were more episodes.  (We have been out of the country since 2007 so missed show when originally ran.),	5	Why did this show only run 2 seasons!,	03-12-2014

A16H208JVRTMU4	B001F6ZIXC	Herbert Nap Herb	This is with out a doubt the best show on tv. A cross between the Shield and the Soprano's! It has action,drama,comedy,and a great story line.(no, Im not a biker)I stayed up all night and finished the first season.If the second season is as good I will stay up all night and watch it!,	5	Best thing showing,	06-09-2010
ASYGCF8ALSKB8	B001F6ZIXC	irabby	Interesting and is attempting to create its own philosophical base which seems to be slowly building to a confrontation between the two main characters. I believe that the attempt to romanticize the story and make the characters into heroes is somewhat unbelievable but works in the context of the story. The attempt to create non stereotypical characters works with some and doesn't with other. It has my interest and I will continue to see how the story develops,	4	It seems to improve as I watch the episodes,	11-05-2013

A3V8B35WJ8YABI	B001F6ZIXC	LT	The plot, characters, and overall production are well done.  Having the main characters being outlaws with some moral code is always an interesting prospective but it works for this season.  Definitely worth watching.,	4	Great Season,	04-02-2013

A244GH5DAURRV2	B001F6ZIXC	Rebecca Collins	I rated this 5 starts because I enjoy the show -- it is tantalizing - and I cannot put it down.The only negative parts that I would change are some of the words/language used which is very stout  - and some of the scenes which are a little too sexual graphic .. but the show overall is a good one.,	5	I cannot stop watching ...,	05-12-2014
A2Z1OYDJFB2E16	B001F6ZIXC	Sam	The characters are well cast and believable. The storyline keeps you interested and coming back for more. There is violence but at this point it is not excessive but as the series continues the violence escalates. The show gets five stars and one of the primary reasons I gave it five is the noticeable lack of profanity in the script. There is a tendency to use four letter words to keep viewers from noticing that the writers have no better way to hold your interest, like an intelligent dialog between characters.,	5	Good entertainment,	01-05-2014
A2M6SAHM4XJTAC	B001F6ZIXC	S. E. Bradfield	Well, it's great fun if you like extreme violence and soap opera. Normally neither one of those by itself can get me excited, let alone combined. In this case Kurt Sutter and crew have pulled off a masterpiece. It takes great writing, great producing, great directing and great acting to get me interested in the lives of people I wouldn't want to know, let alone be, and that's exactly what 'Sons of Anarchy' has. Sutter manages to borrow just the right amount of Shakespeare's 'Hamlet' and 'The Godfather' to make a show similar to 'The Sopranos' but from the bottom of the criminal barrel rather than the top. I had never heard of Charlie Hunnam, but this British-born actor is perfect as Jax Teller. Katie Sagal takes a dark turn from her usual comedy as the biker bitch queen who will do just about anything to protect her family, even when it's from people whose only crime is to not fit her twisted idea of perfection. She walks a fine line between &#34;saving&#34; her son and driving him away. Ron Perlman is als...	5	Great Fun,	09-02-2013

A1POHHS62AWZCC	B001F6ZIXC	Turtlex	I wasn't going to watch this series, I waited until season 4(?) to start watching. Thankfully with amazon instant video I didn't have to wait for weekly installments-the suspense probably would have felt like it was killing me. I didn't think a biker show would &#34;do it for me&#34;, I was wrong! This is so much more than &#34;some biker show&#34; intense drama, well thought out psychology and human motivations/emotions, I was totally hooked on this show. One of the characters says about JAX &#34;you have that young Brad Pitt thing going on&#34; it so true, he's beautiful and intense. Katie Segal is awesome as the badass biker mama of the show, the queen bee-I can't believe it's &#34;Peg Bundy&#34; wow! Absolutely love Jimmy Smidts(the suave pimp lol) in the later seasons. Kurt Sutter, the writer and creator of the series is a diabolical genius-I don't say this lightly-he puts a lot into making this a high quality series from story, cinematography, actors to the perfect music. This show has it all I'm so ...	5	Give this show a chance! Love Kurt Sutter!,	04-04-2014

A2GHUBMHT0VCGJ	B001G8MP9Y	TW	IIt's a good season though I enjoyed 4 and 5 more so probably because of the former Director I thought she was great. And as some had hoped I'm sure for those whom are dedicated fans, probably felt that Gibbs and Shepard would eventually gotten together had she continued in the show. Not sure why they had to kill her off the show. But when season 6 got going with the new Director didn't like him at first. But as each season went on began to like him better. Now that they are doing season 10 and hopefully 11 next fall. All the cast fit well together it seems. Though have heard rumors that someone is leaving the show. I don't know for sure who yet. But if you look at reality of the show. Gibbs and Ducky would be approaching retirement age in the real life if they keep it that way. Unless Gibbs were to get promoted to Director or Assistant Director. Ducky even though I really like the guy with all the talk he does speaking of historical things as he works. I just hope if they do retire Gibbs or promote him To...	5	NCIS season 6,	09-07-2013

A10CJINP7KBR4W	B001GRVAUU	M. Herzog	I'm well aware that American dad has its haters, and I don't always disagree with the criticisms.  However, I really think the show keeps improving, both in writing and comedic jokes.  To me this deserves recognition as most shows rely on the same tired formula and writing, which eventually gets lazy and repetitive (see the office).  American Dad has really tried to make itself a bit better as it grows, and this season shows it.  I'm not going to argue that its shakespeare, or the best comedy going, but I give credit where credit is due.  This volume made me laugh constantly, and unlike most american dad episodes, they didn't feel quite so disposable.  If you're a fan of american dad, its a no brainer, get it, you'll love it.  If you have seen the show, and only kind of like it, this volume may surprise you, give it a chance.,	4	A show that improves,	10-07-2010

A1QDKPNGXV0MYU	B001GRVMLM	Desiree Merrick	I love and loved this show.  It was so cheap of FOX and/CBS to cancel this show.  The Unit was the only military serial show I have ever gotten into mostly because the missions were such a huge part of the show and the family life a side dish  I don't think more seasons will ever be made and that is unfortunate.,	5	This show is stellar,	05-11-2014
A24KKRCPD755UI	B001GRVMLM	George Shaffer	Best show of this type I have ever enjoyed.  To bad the geniuses at Fox tv cancelled it.  Though such an off the grid Unit, if it existed could be a very dangerous tool in the wrong hands , I love the show.I would like to think there is a part of the Delta Force or the navy Seals out there somewhere that operates this way.  However since the Tragedy of Benghazi  occurred the way it did , with politicians and political motives taking priority over protecting American lives , I doubt seriously if there is such a Team that serves up some justice,  Unless it benefits  some politician.,	5	Refreshing.,	05-12-2014

Also included is the stories of their wives, which makes it even more interesting.,	5	The Unit is great story!!!,	07-12-2014
A1F75QQEQ00OLD	B001GRVMLM	nurse_judith	The Unit season 4 has really up'ed the ante for a secret military action packed series.  I have not always cared for the wives part in the series but was amazed with a well put together series that showed their intelligence and &#34;stand by your man&#34; character.  It got a 5 star rating because it produced a solid written story that was interesting and amusing. It caused me to become addicted to what happens next.  A great series you won't want to miss.,	5	THE UNIT - SEASON 4*  THIS IS A GREAT ACTION SERIES,	05-09-2014

A339TP5W8PPQPH	B001GRVMLM	Timothy J. Gannon	This was an action packed series and the last season was as good as the first. I liked the technique of two stories running in parallel. The personal interactions of people and friends and wives with their various problems was very realistic. he series skips the long hours of boring training and life between hot action.,	5	Sad the story has ended,	05-11-2014
ARFPGL7OEATYH	B001GRVMLM	USERBOSCO	It's hard to suspend disbelief with these shows but they're still a fun distraction.  The stories are kind of disjointed and dead ends in a few places, but whatever.  Pretty simple formula: One part &#34;24&#34;, one part Macgyver, and shake in a little covert sneak-a-roo and you've got The Unit.  Some of the focus on the wives was plain painful, but great acting all in all.,	4	Macgyver meets black ops,	07-01-2014
A21GDMT9JN2A5Y	B001GRVMLM	Wayward Traveller WaywardT	I still can't believe this show was cancelled this season.

A2WE24HCTKKM4X	B001HBLE2O	Roy Clark rclarknv	Yes, the concept is tricky; but it was ably smoothed out after the first episode. Everything was improved (they were five stars start to too-soon finish.) So MY OWN WORST ENEMY joins FIREFLY and a long list of other too-good-for-the-Networks.MY OWN WORST ENEMY is, er, was a great series. Their quality showed in every episode - their international locations and consistently fine components (noted in the title, above)would have found an audience eager for such quality. And Slater was a charismatic, forceful lead; at the same time, believable as a domesticated wage slave and a covett operative. I hope Network management reads the comments of disappointed viewers; for MY OWN WORST ENEMY and the many prematurely axed shows which have been inappropriately turned into history.Methinks that Network canceling executives have a very dim view of their viewers. Foolish, too.

A2FY4HEDJIF8UX	B001JB3T02	NurseyBee	Unlike many shows for kids and pre-teens on television, I actually like iCarly and have no problem watching it with the kids. Season 2 is my favorite season to date. The characters have already been developed, and they build on existing relationships, including Gibby. Spencer is our favorite character on the show. It's not too crazy for younger kids, and it has enough entertainment value to it that adults can sometimes watch it without wanting to jump off a building.,	5	Cute show,	01-08-2014
ARB0Z68675VPJ	B001JB3T02	robert kush	I remember when I first started watching this show in 2009 and, even though I&#34;m not a kid, I thought it was so funny! It&#34;s too bad that Nickolodeon ended iCarly in November 2012! So I decided to buy it on DVD! I&#34;m waiting for the last two Seasons to come out on DVD! Let&#34;s see there is, of course, Carly Shay, Spenser Shay, her crazy way out there Artist brother, Freddie, the guy is crazy about Carly, Sam Pucket, played by Jennette McCurdy, There are a host of other characters on the show, too, like, Gibby( Gib-bbah!), who they are all over on their Internet online show &#34;iCarly&#34;. I do recommend this show very highly and I still say Nick made a big mistake ending this show like they did....there should, at least, be a follow-up movie! So, with that, let me have front row seat and my bag of popcorn, I&#34;m watching &#34;iCarly Season 2&#34;.,	4	Fun filled TV show that kids will love....of all ages!,	06-05-2014

A39S5KUUUVRSVF	B001JGECT4	mongiesgirl	Really, all I can go by is that my grandson keeps asking me to watch Deigo. I don't sit and watch it with him but I can hear him calling out the answers to Diego's questions and when it over he wants to watch another. I have seen a few episodes and I like how they get the child involved and it is actually a teaching show. So they are not just sitting numbly spaced out watching cartoons. One time I purposely called out the wrong answer and he corrected me! Great. I was just checking to make sure he was understanding. He is 2 1/2 years.,	5	Captures his attention.,	03-06-2014

Archive brings &#34;Batman: The Brave and the Bold: The Complete First Season&#34; to Blu-ray for the first time in a 2-Disc edition versus the different volumes it was originally released in a few years back. All 26 episodes are here for fans waiting frantically to get them in high-definition. For those who might not know, this series has more in common with the camp approach to the Caped Crusader than Christopher Nolan's grimmer &#34;Dark Knight&#34; Trilogy.Batman prides himself on protecting the city of Gotham City as a solo crime fighter. However, there are many times when the world is threatened on a global scale. Our hero must join forces with the likes of Aquaman, Plastic Man, Green Arrow, Wild Cat, Dr. Fate, and many others when these perils reveal themselves.Although &#34;Batman: The Brave and the Bold: The Complete First Season&#34; is presented on manufacture-on-demand recordable Blu-rays, the audio and video quality is top-notch.

A2N60VDBR10N18	B001LUW8G2	Tyler Johnson	It's finally here. The collection that we have been waiting on for nearly four years has finally arrived, and its almost everything that I could have asked for. To be perfectly honest, I didn't think we would ever see Batman: The Brave and the Bold in the glorious hi-def picture that we so richly deserved. The only downside is that, again, this set sadly lacks the special features that were absent on the dvd collections as well.The picture and sound quality are wonderful, seeing as this show was gorgeous in the first place. This set is the COMPLETE first season, not the half season releases we saw with the DVD collections. There really isn't much to say beyond this. Batman the brave and the bold is a fun, bright, imaginative, absolute blast of a TV show, and now its finally on Blu-ray. It is a great show, and deserves to be in your collection.

I don't know how it got by me for all those years. Right from the very first minute of the very first season it rocked. I'm almost at the end of the third season and it still rocks! The Characters all click; each actor is so perfectly suited to their role. I honestly can't say one negative things about Flashpoint except that the show is no longer being made! This could have easily been a 10 year run. Anyway - well worth your time if you're into this type of genre.  Yummy stuff!,	5	Refreshing,	09-04-2013

A691XU34BVWME	B001N4PPWK	JM	I don't get the almost perfect reviews of this show - have these people watched anything else ?  I'm halfway through the first season - the acting is only OK, the characters don't really gel well together and the plots are usually so ridiculous they go beyond unbelievable.  I just finished watching Mile High where at the end, with cheesy graphics they land a 747 SAFELY on the Key West 7 mile bridge. James Bond called to say this show is ridiculous.  I keep waiting for the bad guys to burst out laughing when they are 'duped', instead of falling for what's being done on them.  And most of the shows don't move around location - one was entirely filmed in a house, another was entirely filmed in a plane, etc. This isn't a bad show - it's ok, just be very weary of all the 5 star reviews which I find very odd after watching half the first season.  I love the show Burn Notice which crushes this if you are looking for something better.,	3	Be wary of any movie rating on Amazon almost 5 stars,	02-11-2014

A342CAVHO0T0PC	B001ODQA4C	Flying Lady 76 N2theBlue	I enjoyed season two.  Shocking end, but very well done.  I used to think only here in the USA that we had gangs, illegal guns, terrorists and good old fashion poverty, but this series is set in Toronto and shows human nature at its most vulnerable and that these human condition exist everywhere to one degree or another.The characters are very likable.  You see just enough of their private lives to be interesting and engage your interest without overwhelming the show.  Enrico Colantoni, is a spectacular actor and never disappoints no matter the role.  I have seen him in Veronica Mars, Just Shoot Me, and most recently in Person of Interest.  He is able to adapt to a role and make it believable.  Hugh Dillon is wonderful and David Paetkau is just plain HOT!  Where's the fan?  :)This is a police procedural with all the trimmings and well worth watching.,	5	This is a great series - Wonderful actors - and realistic tales!,	06-05-2014

A2SLA0SXRQV8M0	B001PN63PC	Andres C. Salama	An interesting drama about an imperfect love triangle. Joaquin Phoenix plays Leonard, a man perhaps in his early thirties, living in an apartment in Brooklyn with his parents, a Jewish couple who have a small dry cleaning operation where Leonard works. Leonard has a story behind him: an engagement with a girl was broken some years ago when they found that they were genetically incompatible, and he has tried to kill himself in the past, more than once. His parents, worried by him, try to set him up with Sandra, the nice daughter of a fellow (and apparently wealthier) Jewish businessman. Though not terribly enthusiastic about Sandra, he starts going out with her, who is very attracted to him (why a seemingly down to earth person like Sandra would be attracted to an obviously troubled person like Leonard is unclear, though I suppose things like this happen, though not very usually, in real life). But just when Leonard and Sandra start meeting and knowing each other, he meets Michelle (Gwyneth Paltrow, who is ...	5	Well made drama, with great performances,	12-08-2009
A3EXWV8FNSSFL6	B001PN63PC	Daniel G. Lebryk	This film has a lot going for it. Three absolutely gorgeous women, Gwyneth Paltrow, Vinessa Shaw, and Isabella Rossellini. A quirky lead male, Joaquin Phoenix (yes the same one that had the idiotic much parodied interview with David Letterman). A complex love story, but one that seems more honest and true than the silly happy stories usually told. Interesting camera work and lighting - filmed in muted tones. And excellent direction and writing by James Gray.The film opens with Leonard (Joaquin Phoenix) jumping off a low bridge. As he floats downward, he sees an image in his mind and decides to live. There is something not exactly 100% with Leonard. He lives at home, there are cryptic questions about where he was four months ago, and he moves and talks in a halting not altogether there mode. The love triangle is a bit different. Sandra (Vinessa Shaw) likes Leonard. She's single, saw Leonard at his father's dry cleaner, and decided to set up a pretext to meet him. Leonard isn't 100% interested, but there's s...	5	Sad Beautiful Love Story,	08-07-2009
A13E0ARAXI6KJW	B001PN63PC	Ed Uyeshima	I notice the strong influence of Elia Kazan (On the Waterfront,Splendor in the Grass) in James Gray's intimate 2009 character-driven drama, the signposts being the human scale of the story and the realistic dilemmas faced by the main characters. The director/screenwriter manages to achieve a somber stillness to the film that allows the actors to breathe and inhabit their roles in a more subtle manner than you would expect from a story focused on working-class lives in Brooklyn's Brighton Beach neighborhood. The plot focuses on Leonard Kraditor, a moody, suicidal young man in the aftermath of a nervous breakdown triggered by the end of an engagement forced by genetic disorders running in both their families. Consequently, it would have been impossible for them to have healthy children. Grappling with bipolar disorder, Leonard has moved back with his parents working half-heartedly at the family dry-cleaning business, as they seek out a suitable replacement fianc&eacute;e. She comes in the form of Sandra, the...	4	Romantic Triangle  Drama Benefits from Gray's Introspective, Kazan-Like Approach,	04-05-2010

A328S9RN3U5M68	B001PN63PC	Grady Harp	TWO LOVERS is an intimate film that requires that the viewer can identify with or at least care about the characters it depicts.  Otherwise this is a pretty dark film with few moments of light to redeem the rather depressing story.  It is a verismo style contemporary tale of choices made by vulnerable and rather weak people living life in a closed world.Brighton Beach, Brooklyn is the shadowing decaying setting where we first meet Leonard (Joaquin Phoenix) making a delivery for his father's dry cleaning business, deciding instead to jump off a bridge in suicidal dejection: Leonard is a lost soul, bipolar to boot, a wannabe photographer who has just been crushed by the end of a relationship (both partners decide that marriage won't work because they both carry the gene for Tay-Sachs disease, a fact that would prevent their having healthy children).  Salvaged by passersby, Leonard proceeds to his parent's (Isabella Rossellini and Moni Monoshov) apartment, the setting for a careful preparation of Leonard for ...	3	The Dark Side,	07-05-2009
A2G5KL6WVDZFD6	B001PN63PC	Libby Bryer	Phoenix plays a character very similar to the lethargic James Dean or early Brando.  It took me over half the movie to get used to him and appreciate the character.  I can't say I enjoyed it, but again, I appreciated his acting.  Paltrow, well, pretty and pouty - anyone could have played her part. Interesting ending that would be worth the argument at a party with a bunch of opinionated men and women. Hey, that might be a reason to watch it!  There ya go!,	3	Artsy fartsy a la carte,	04-10-2014
A1W9JB3KRSDEQD	B001PN63PC	singer mg	That's what this film is about, immaturity.  You have a guy who is basically still a child so he chooses his love like a teenager, he cannot look people in the eye and tell them what he really wants and he tries to run away from home like a little boy. That said the film does end with a nice resolution that perhaps points to emotional growth.  Its not the best film but its not the worse either.  I would recommend renting this before investing in owning a copy as I doubt its the kind of film anyone would want to see more than once.,	3	Immaturity,	02-06-2011
AAZRWLML88IZK	B001QDDILI	A kids review	The things I have enjoyed about House are still present in the fifth season of the show. The character drama is handled extremely well, the acting is top notch, and all around this season has some incredibly solid episode. While not every episode is a hit and some of the storylines don't feel quite right, this is a very stable season that is easily 4 stars. This is by far one of the most unique medical dramas ever and it's a testament to the show's quality that it can stay interesting even after 100 episodes.,	4	House, M.D. - Season Five,	08-11-2011

A24IJY3V0804WJ	B001QDDILI	Amit Talpade	I used to love this show when it first premiered and have been a faithful follower throughout all its many seasons. Having said that I feel that the antics of Dr. House are getting a bit tiresome and I am waiting for either Dr. Wilson or someone else to punch him in the face. The storyline remains the same, a medical mystery is presented at the beginning of the show and the rest of the show is devoted to the eventual solution. I will watch it to the end but the writing has to improve.,	3	The show needs a new direction and writing needs to improve,	12-05-2009
A3N6GAJTEOF4MO	B001QDDILI	Caleb Williams	Up to season 5 House was known as focusing a lot on the comical witticisms of House as he insulted his colleagues and his boss. This particular season takes a more serious turn, and although there does exist the comedy that it's famous for, there is a more serious aura around the entire season and its characters as all is not well in the land of Dr. Gregory House. For a medical drama, House is pretty special as it retains a very formulaic style of storytelling and wholly stays away from soap opera dramatics; instead replacing them with casual love stories, complex medical cases and an even more complex main star.Just when we think we know House, the show takes another massive turn and shows us a completely different side to him that we never thought existed. Season 5 seeks on exposing a new emotional side to House. At the end of season 4 we saw the end to Wilsons girlfriend, Amber and what we are lead to believe to be the friendship of House and Wilson. Season 5 opens with our worst fears, Wilson quits and...	5	As Always, Amazing,	06-02-2009
A10CJINP7KBR4W	B001QDDILI	M. Herzog	Season 5 shows signs that House's premise may be wearing a little thin.  The premise of course is that every episode involves someone getting sick, several failed attempts to save said person, then House hears or says something that makes him realize the actual disease/problem and saves the patient.  While this was cleverly intermixed with a number side stories, usually involving personal issues, this season the premise was wearing a little thin to me.  Most the time I didn't care much about the case this season as I knew the pattern and wasn't very surprised.  This is the trouble with all premised shows, eventually you get used to the pattern, then get a little tired with it.Similarly, the side stories weren't nearly as interesting this season.  While I thought House looking for a replacement for Wilson was rather interesting, I was a little surprised by how quickly this story was over, thought I was thrilled to have Wilson back.  Also, the budding of a new romance felt a little forced, and was ultimately...	4	Premise is wearing thin...,	10-06-2009

A3OK08U7I556AV	B001QDKK3W	Darlene	I have always loved Tim Roth and think he does a great job in this series.  This is such an extraordinary topic!  I don't know if there is scientific evidence to back up the theory around which the show revolves but suspect there is.  I will be looking into it a bit deeper.  I just don't understand why it only ran 3 seasons. I guess mainstream America didn't get it but I love it!!,	5	PHENOMENAL!,	05-04-2014

A3LG4Z2EAE3BO2	B001QDKK3W	Jo Ann Massaro	I am hooked not only on this series but on the technology. I will never look at some ones' face the same way again.

The acting in this series is superb and the casting perfect. A must watch.,	5	Amazing,	06-07-2014
A1I5LC05HZJ9CF	B001QDKK3W	Kanenberg 50kmwalk	Wow, unexpectedly great show--I'd give it 10 stars if I could. Dr. Lightman (Tim Roth) doesn't just read facial cues to tell when folks are lying--he's pretty darn good at telling lies himself. This show is fresh, original, and addictive. I never would have thought the show would work with Tim Roth in the lead but he's terrific as are the other 2 main characters--you want to know what's going to happen to these people. And unlike another reviewer I liked how season 1 ended. These folks who study the science of lying have a gift, and that gift is both a blessing & a curse as you will see thru the first 13 episodes. Can't wait for season 2.,	5	Awesome; compelling; entertaining; original.,	12-12-2009

A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2	B001QDKK3W	Kevin L. Nenstiel omnivore	Based loosely on recent developments in cognitive psychology, this smart, inventive series explores what television can do when put to good purposes.  Unlike most recent television, which pitches to the lowest common denominator, this series courts an active, engaged audience.  Which, unfortunately, probably explains its consistent low ratings.  I hope this intelligent but struggling show has a future.Tim Roth as Cal Lightman plays a deeply conflicted man, whose intelligence, which makes everything he does in this series possible, also alienates him from the entire human race.  His supporting cast does an admirable job giving him room to play out his idiosyncrasies, but also carrying their own weight in the stories.  And the look of the show contrasts governmental faux classical with slick stainless steel to great effect.Sometimes the characters grasp overly simple answers.  They often reach snap decisions, when in fact analyzing tiny nonverbal cues requires time and effort, and still requires subjective i...	4	Smart, Underappreciated Series,	04-03-2011

A275WJBGGUHC89	B001QDKK3W	Marilyn M. Green	I didn't watch the original TV program on Fox so I enjoyed watching the episodes on my Kindle. This is a well written and well acted drama. Facial and voice cues are used to determine if someone is lying. Cases involve a variety of situations so it is not repetitive. The mix of work and family in the show is enjoyable to watch. I would recommend Lie to Me to anyone who likes crime dramas. I realize that Fox cancelled Lie to Me due to low ratings. I don't remember seeing ads for the show so I wonder if they promoted it well enough.,	5	Fox was wrong.,	06-04-2014
A331OF34UX4Y1K	B001QDKK3W	M. Fonseca carmarthen	This short (13 episodes) first season of Lie To Me was a big surprise to me. The show format and concept of the stories are not particularly groundbreaking, but good scripts, superb acting and a likeable ensemble cast make it above average (in my opinion).Kelli Williams is simply breathtaking as Dr. Gillian Foster. She's gorgeous, mature, self-assured without being cocky. Tim Roth, that did not need to prove anything, once again show his talent.This is the kind of DVD set to watch in one week maximum!I don't know why Season One was so short.,	4	Great surprise!

A1XNQSREG1K5MS	B001QDKK3W	Savannah	This show is built around the idea of being able to detect when a person is lying by the presence or absence of facial and body cues.  The Lightman Group, comprised of Dr. Lightman and a talented group of associates are  engaged by various individuals and groups to determine if a lie is being told, and who is lying.  This job is not as cut and dry and it sounds.  The group uncovers much during their investigation.  Meanwhile, we are given glimpses into the lives of each of the main characters, each of whom is lying about or hiding something.  Really good show.,	5	Refreshingly Different!,	05-08-2014

A2LRWMHJ1ZK36M	B001SE07JG	e. verrillo	Dollhouse is what happens when networks have bad ideas, and then hire good writers to carry them out.Bad idea #1: Signing Eliza Dushku for her own show.  Face it, Dushku can't act.  The only thing she can do is be Eliza Dushku, which, to be fair, she does quite well. (But, then again, I can do me quite well.)Bad idea #2: The premise. Why would you need to wipe Eliza Dushku's brain to have her do things that other perfectly well-trained professionals could do better? And why have the same person do all these things, in public, if you need to keep the whole operation secret?Bad idea #3: High heels. We know she is short, but Dushku's heels look really out of place with a gingham dress.Bad idea #4: Treading water for 5 episodes, having Dushku do pointless, implausible things (in high heels) while Whedon figures out how the ^#@! to plug up all the plot holes before the entire cast drowns in them.Good idea! Hiring Joss Whedon, who is a bit of a genius, and is the only person who could possibly clean up this mess...	3	Not as good as anything else Whedon has done,	09-06-2010

A3LOEAFCDUA1W7	B001SE1FAG	Nate	JT is one the strongest players to play Survivor. Stephen is one of the smartest to ever play the game. These 2 paired up makes up one of the greatest duos in survivor history. Coach is an obnoxious player who thinks he knows everything and is a big joke. This is his first appearance out of his 3 times playing and is one of a kind. Eddie George's wife Taj is in this game and probably would be voted out early but she finds something that helps her stay in the game. Tocantins is probably the worst location Survivor could ever choose. The island setting is more fitting for survivor and Africa is a good switch up because of the wildlife. There really isn't anything good about the Brazilian highlands. Exile island is a big sand dune and 2 people from opposite tribes get an opportunity to form an alliance.

A2R1HAXRNU0QX7	B001TNVEKC	RMurray847	THE GREAT BUCK  HOWARD is a charming, breezy, fairly family-friendly movie with a nice cast and an almost old-fashioned vibe.  It's far from a great movie, and yet it has a quirky originality that makes it worth a look.Buck Howard (John Malkovich) is a mentalist.  In fact, his act is based on The Amazing Kreskin, the hypnotist/mentalist/magician who frequently appeared on Johnny Carson and other talk shows like that.  Buck is a fading star however, playing to half-empty theaters in mid-sized cities all around the country.  His audience is mostly senior citizens who clearly remember this guy from his days of appearing on THE DINAH SHORE SHOW.  His act is sort of dreadful...yet it's sort of amazing too.  Colin Hanks plays Troy, a law-school dropout who wants to be a writer, but stumbles into the job of being Buck's road manager.The film follows Buck on tour, as he works to achieve a comeback of sorts.  He doesn't quite seem to get that the likelihood of that is very dim.  He isn't deluded enough to think his...	4	Modest, quirky and very charming, with a wonderful cast.,	03-06-2010

In most episodes, the parents are kind and teach the kids sportsmanship. Just like with everything else, there's a good and bad side. And there's some things that might shock as well anger some. But this is a show, like any other.What saddens me, are the reviews that the comments that are so catty and mean. It's a show. Treat it as such.

I am not surprised that it only got one season. There are alot of wonderful things about this show. Crafted well, acting is first rate, and while some of the plot lines are predictable, they are written and performed well. It's a great premise and the possibilities are sadly left unfulfilled.

Jack is my favorite character, despite being an antagonist, and he goes through some very real and identifiable struggles.  This is incredible fiction.The series ends on an ambiguous note -- it doesn't really work as a series finale -- but this 13-hour journey is something I've watched three times from start to finish because it is such a delight.,	5	Beautifully Scripted,	04-08-2014

When we eagerly waiting for the new season, we would rehash the past season, making possible plot's all our own, you know, really into it. Then when the announced date came and went, we researched, what went wrong. Found out it had been cancelled.  That was my first realization that TV had become like all other business, just that. Business. So disappointed with major networks. They had managed, with Kings, to create a possible alternate future of our world, that did not involve space ships or aliens or even magic.

A1LPKQWRHTAHQN	B001UUAGRQ	Frankie D	Not a fan of this series. It has its moments and can be funny and has good drama and action at times.  Charactors are weird and crazy.

A10CJINP7KBR4W	B001UUAGRQ	M. Herzog	Before I review the season, I feel the need to let potential buyers know that this season 5 is merely a compilation of the dvd sets for season 5.1 and 5.2.  Not just the discs are the same, but the actual packaging for these sets, including the covers are included as well.  Essentially this is just a large cover over the two sets previously available.  So, if you have the other sets, there's nothing knew.  Similarly, if you have 5.1, better stick with getting 5.2 when its on sale (if its still available).  However, if you don't have either, this is the way to go, even though it's a slightly clunky packaging.As to the show, it feels like a return to form in many ways.  Not that season 4 was bad, it just felt like the show was starting to show some signs of aging.  Season 5 really ups the ante, and makes the show feels fresh again, something difficult for a show five seasons in its run.  I was shocked by Michael J. Fox's performance, definitely out of character of his usual role, and rather impressive.  He p...	5	Excellent season,	06-07-2010

A2MLZ4NWSGL5G7	B001V98S2G	ap0gee	This show was absolutely fantastic - sharp, sarcastic, and funny. It mocked the absurdities of the office culture, employers' complete disregard of the well-being of employees, and a vast gap between the management and the 'drones.' I am mystified why it was cancelled after only two seasons, but am also glad that I did not get to see its decline - which reminds me of 'Common Law' - another great but prematurely cancelled comedy show. I'm happy to own it ; I re-watched some episodes many times. Oh, and those Veridian Dynamics 'ads' are a strike of pure genius!,	5	A short-lived but fantastic show,	12-05-2013

AN6NGSXZXMZZ9	B001V98S2G	marie s.	For the time this series was on TV, this show covered issues that could become a reality sometime soon. It has silly humor and dray humor interspersed. Not only that, but also unafraid to joke about controversial issues that producers are afraid to touch today. You may want to give it a few episodes to get into it, like the Eureka series takes.,	4	Sci Fi Sitcom,	04-07-2014
A2NHUJAZARLNKC	B001V98S2G	Mark C	A fabulous show that was cancelled far too early. For those who haven't watched it, the show is a satirical situation comedy that focuses on a fictional multi-national corporation called 'Veridian Dynamics'. The main character, Ted, is the head of research and development and oversees a quirky team of scientists and product testers. I love the humor and the relationships between the characters. Portia de Rossi is perfectly cast as the emotionless member of management. The 'commercials' for Veridian Dynamics are hysterical. I highly recommend this show!,	5	Cancelled far too early,	10-07-2013

I've watched alongside them, and it's easy to get caught up in this tale of mermaids living on land.  They manage to mingle daily life with a magical world without being inappropriate.  Girls always love mermaids, and let's face it, don't you get tired of the Disney stuff?  This show, is free of all the canned laughter, corny old jokes, product placement, agendas and hidden messages that Disney (and most American TV) puts in all the kids shows nowadays.  It's nice to see a show the kids can just enjoy, learning gentle lessons about right and wrong, friendship and so on.,	5	Stamp of Approval,	07-09-2014

A1POFVVXUZR3IQ	B001Y5913C	Z Hayes	My daughter loves stories about mermaids, and when I saw that this Australian-made TV show, H20, centered around three teenage girls who are able to transform into mermaids, I thought it was worth checking out. I am glad I did because my soon to be nine-year-old daughter absolutely adores this series! I made it a point to watch it with her to make sure the series had nothing objectionable in terms of content or language but I needn't have worried. This is a wholesome, family-friendly show that explores mainly problems of friendship and relationships at a level that is appropriate for its target audience of girls ages 7-13.In Season 1, three girls, Ricki Chadwick (Cariba Heine), Emma Gilbert (Claire Holt), and Cleo Sertori (Phoebe Tonkin who went on to star in the short-lived American witch-themed series,The Secret Circle ) play sixteen-year-old girls who get stranded on Mako Island, a strange and mysterious place.

A328S9RN3U5M68	B001YDZYE4	Grady Harp	Deborah Kampmeier has written and directed an atmospheric film about life in the South (Alabama to be specific) in the 1950s, using this confused period of time to examine how a child can rise out of her squalid surroundings, replacing her disappointments in expectations of family, friends, and trauma with tenuous grip on the dream of becoming a performer like her idol Elvis Presley.Fortunate for Kampmeier she cast the rather amazing young Dakota Fanning to inhabit the role of the feisty but abused Lewellen, a headstrong prepubescent girl whose mother deserted her at birth, leaving her to live with her abusive lothario, worthless father (David Morse) whose current paramour is his ex-wife's sister (Robin Wright Penn) who leaves Lewellen also when the father's abuse and desertion overwhelm.  Lewellen's sole friend is young Buddy (Cody Sanford) who shares show and tell games with Lewellen until a promise to find tickets for an Elvis Presley concert includes a 'favor' for Buddy's older friend (the rape sequenc...	4	The South, The Fifties, and Emergence,	03-01-2009
A1K6K23WG0IBWE	B001YDZYE4	Quadro Sinead Summer	I decided to watch this film based mostly on the fact that Isabelle Fuhrman had a role in it. I saw her incredible performance as the evil adopted child in the horror film Orphan and was interested in seeing her again. She has a very brief role and the script offers her nothing much to work with. Luckily I found Dakota Fanning's performance in War or the worlds very worthy and she also was worth taking notice. Its an amazing treat to watch child actors as they form their careers into lasting ones. Few get there, But some come to mind that have really blazed an impressive trail of solid and memorable performances. Jodie Foster, Linda Blair, Juliette Lewis, Leonardo DiCaprio to name a few have become serious actors. Houndog is a film that truly gives Fanning the perfect opportunity to show just how good she really is. Her performance was brilliant. The story is slow and a rather sad and empty one. And its all the more painful to see the tragic and painful moments never really getting resolved. For example sh...	3	Pretty good little movie, but not much more than that,	05-07-2013
AUM3YMZ0YRJE0	B001YDZYE4	Robert J. Crawford	This is another of those indy films that is so good it is difficult to watch.  Fanning is a young girl on the verge of adolescence, who has that natural talent for singing that so many children lose.  She lives in a vivid rural milieu with a father who is a heavy drinker and an absent mother.  Her friends include a neighbor boy and a wonderfully lively group of southern blacks, whom she accompanies as an elvis singer.  It is warm and she is evidently going to become an extraordinary beauty.However, she is introduced to sex at too early an age.  This is not, as some reviewers have claimed, about early sexuality - there is nothing titillating about it whatsoever.  Indeed, completely unprepared, the theme of the story is that it nearly breaks her spirit.  It is about the possibility of healing and it is extremely, graphically realistic.  Fanning's performance was, in my opinion, oscar-worthy.Warmly recommended.  Just be prepared for stark realism.,	4	excellent art-house look into truncated childhood,	12-07-2011

A3OXHLG6DIBRW8	B0021HAG5E	C. Hill CFH	Mutant Chronicles is an entertaining and well produced movie that has Sci-Fi, Steam-Punk, Zombie, horror, and Post-Apocalyptic elements. This was a lot more enjoyable than I expected it to be.No plot spoilers from me; the movie's back story is a little weak, but it doesn't really detract much from the movie as there are hints (both verbal and visual) that help to fill in some of the questions. Once the action starts, it is fairly easy to get into the story. The world of the 2700s is divided into four corporate blocks, each fighting to control the few remaining resources of the planet. This is literal fighting with armies battling the old fashioned way, which leads to a very surrealistic opening scene. The story follows a band of soldiers who attempt a last ditch effort to save the earth from zombie like mutants that the fighting has inadvertently unleashed. There really isn't any subplot and there is minimal character development beyond what's needed to build some viewer rapport with the main heroes.The fi...	4	Enjoyable Cross Genre Flick - Recommended,	09-10-2009
A2DAHERP7HYJGO	B0021HAG5E	Mark Turner	There are movies that are released that you think will be good, movies you hope will be good and movies you want to be good. On occasion it happens. But for the most part, as with MUTANT CHRONICLES, it never quite makes the mark.Based on a role playing game, the basic outline was there. Fans of the game though have complained at the changes made. In any event, we are presented with a world of the future ruled by four warring corporations constantly in battle. During the latest conflict, a seal set in the ground is broken and an army of zombie like mutants, each with one single spear-like arm, is unleashed.History reveals that this seal was put in place by a religious order when an alien spacecraft descended to Earth and began changing men into these mutants. Nearly defeated, man conquered this invasion and sealed the machine in the ground. The order maintained a book telling the tale as well as preparing for the day the seal might be broken.

AGPTXSO5FLVYQ	B0025Z8G4K	A. House	As an avid detective drama reader/viewer, this series started out very unusual. I started to view it and then stopped and finally went back one day when nothing was on TV. &#34;The Unusuals&#34; is different because the characters are developed more than other detective programs so there is a split focus: characters and criminals. Once I got into it I really liked it  I was just very disappointed that I couldn't watch the following seasons.,	4	Unusuals was unusual,	03-01-2014
A2LEIANN1UZTHP	B0025Z8G4K	brainout	Understand, I am no fan of cop shows.  There are only three which ever held my attention, and even then, not for long:  Dragnet, due to the droll acting and script;  Car 54 Where Are You, due to the acting and humor;  Law and Order, due to the plots (though acting was good).  Else, I'd much rather spend my time on something else.Because Jeremy Renner was in this, I picked the series to watch in Amazon Prime.  I could never forget his portrayal of Jeffrey Dahmer, and wanted to see Renner play something normal, just to see how he'd act.  So, although I dislike cop shows, I watched this.This series has in it, all the above elements which made the first three listed shows, classics.  The script is lively, quirky, great ensemble characters, believable, full of good twists in the plotline, superb acting, direction and film editing great.  The music is awful, though it fits the theme of the show (way too loud, one must turn the volume down every time the screechy music plays about every 5 minutes, what a pain).He...	4	Good show except for the MUSIC -- maybe that's why it got cancelled?,	05-07-2013

A1FYUCCC8CX1E0	B0025Z8G4K	hugh parker	This series was fairly good sometimes. I dropped it a star because of the volume explosions between scenes.

AA90W95STFGAC	B0025Z8G4K	jj	ABC should be shot over and over again for not keeping this show. I LOVED IT! I only watched it because of the Amazon ratings. Someone at NBC should try to get it back. This was a gem with great plots, great characters, genuine emotion, and lots of humor---- all so very rare on tv. They made only a couple of mistakes: they needed a little summary at the beginning of each episode so you could get caught up if it was your first episode...you have to do this with continuing story lines. And, sorry, but I thought the lead should have been a bigger, gorgeous guy, although the guy in it was a great actor.BRING IT BACK!,	5	Best show I have seen in a long time!,	01-04-2014

A wonderful cast with crazy stories and personalities I'd love to see again and again!  It's painful to know that this is the only season but it's worth watching time and again.  And I will continue to watch it as long as it's available!,	5	Aptly Named Show,	07-11-2013
A2CU2MIERAJ31J	B0025Z8G4K	Marvin Woltje	i am a lover of brit television, so i was surprised, pleasantly, and ecstatic, discovering this gem of american television. this is a romp--witty, sexy, intelligent entertainment, the best kind of comic book.  in my unabashed enjoyment of this s how, i was perplexed as to why it was only one season, and, then, i watched the episode in which banks beats up an alleged serial killer, and it struck me that a black man, beating a white man, even if the black man is a cop and the white man is a very bad guy,. does not sit well with the powers that be, in hollywood, and that's a pity because this show was as brilliant as anything the brits produce--really. it deserves five-out-of-five.,	5	witty,	02-03-2013
A2OADVG5PRZGAN	B0025Z8G4K	mrs natural	We started watching this when there was really nothing on regular tv to watch and it is really pretty good.

A2B3F9EY8TZR8Y	B0025Z8G4K	Nikki	This is a great show. I wish I had known about it when it was on TV. I really like Renner as an actor and he does an awesome job in this role. I'd definitely recommend it to a friend. Shame it didn't have more than one season.,	4	Great show,	12-08-2013

A11A75FIE3396D	B0025Z8G4K	P M. Buchanan mspauly	I'd never heard of this show and tried it for something different.  It's actually as good as most of the genre with likeable characters in the typical law enforcement scenario.,	4	The Unusuals,	10-04-2013
A37W5KV7FHZD12	B0025Z8G4K	reader	This deserved a longer run on Network TV but was cancelled by ABC wayu too quickly. Thoroughly superior series with enjoyable comedy drama. Leaves you wanting much more.,	5	Superior,	09-07-2013
A3FRG9T1MXOOZX	B0025Z8G4K	Sandra Acquistapace	I have to admit I had my doubts at first, but once I completed the first episode, I was hooked.  The acting was first rate and Jeremy Renner iswonderful, as always.  The quirkiness (hope that's a word) of the characters is endearing without being sentimental and by the time the &#34;season&#34; was over, I was quite invested the the &#34;wellbeing&#34; of the characters as they each dealt with their personal demons. This show was cancelled way, way too soon.,	5	I Enjoyed it SO much! I only wish there was more to come.,	01-04-2014

A2CJMDVHOG7YPJ	B00266MPF4	Kathleen Rowland	This show is weird.  They just get off on blowing things up and crashing vehicles.  Thousands of dollars in every crash are being wasted that could be used for a good purpose.,	1	Stupid show.,	03-08-2014
A1P98DMX8YUSNW	B0026MLCRU	Brad Smith	I had a lot of questions, but I still watched this series all the way through. Where do the cameraman and sound man sleep? Are they subjected to the same deprivations, because somebody had to film all this? The cast spends more time in sit downs talking to the camera about what they just did than actually doing it, it seems, at times. Why didn't they try fishing a little more often? In the time they were there, they only caught one fish, yet they are near water almost all the time. I did develop an interest in how this would turn out, and you will, too. The ending is a little contrived. They manage to catch a train out of the wilderness, and somehow it pulls into a station where all their families are waiting to greet them! How did that happen? If you can overlook these gaps in credibility, you'll enjoy this little series. I'm now watching the sequel, set in the Venezuela jungle. Same thing.,	4	Silly, but addictive,	05-02-2013
A1ITC02ET70N89	B0026MLCRU	Bruce Bruce	It's all play acting.  Which is fine, but just admit it.  They all have their button they can push, but they're never in any danger from bears, or exposure, or anything.  It does make you realize just how remarkable primitive people were, who survived such conditions without the special gear these people had.  It did have great scenery, but would have been much better if it spent time showing how things are done, instead of how someone is feeling.,	3	What's the camera crew doing while they sleep under a tarp?,	11-06-2013

A1AFXJ8U72MD6L	B002962RKE	MISTER SJEM sonofhotpie	A  nice change from typical TV and its brought back the musical in a sense.  Glee touches on all types of discriminations without focusing too much on the high school model.  In fact, the teachers are some of the best supporting characters, especially Sue Sylvester (who sometimes steals the show) a la Jane Lynch who first stood out for me in ROLE MODELS.  The creators tapped into Broadway stars to pull this one off and it worked.  The nice thing about the songs is that they don't stick to one decade.  In fact, they cover songs that all generations can remember them even if they're all updated.  This is arguably one of the hottest TV shows in several years and the visiting A list actors and actresses supports my stance.  MY GRADE: A minus to A.,	5	STERLING SILVER QUALITY,	07-11-2010
A1S1BJFTA644TU	B002962RKE	Zalmorion the Fantastic	This show is a series of melodramatic storylines and overly-pop-styled songs that numb the brains of people matured beyond childhood and the tweens.  These eye-roll-inducing scenes are punctuated by genuinely funny appearances by Jane Lynch.  Her comedy is a raw, edgy, intelligent addition to a show that is basically the demons of American Idol possessing a school.If you are a fan of American Idol, Disney teeny bopper shows, and show tunes, watch this.  If not, run for the hills!Vapid melodrama run amuck with Jane Lynch injected to help you keep your sanity.AVOID.,	1	Melodrama and Jane Lynch,	02-08-2014
A2EKSOLTKBGWTK	B0029Z0QVM	Jraptor	I am still mad about them canceling Sarah Conner Chronicles. Its one of the few TV series that I really, really wanted to know what was going to happen next. The people who cancelled that series should be a;lsdk kdfjklFII!!! (its too bad for a Amazon review).Ok, so, if you haven't seen that series watch it. The second season is even better than the first.This video is animated and has graphics about the level of todays consoles (PS3/Xbox), but don't let that stop you. Its pretty good and lets cross our fingers that if the Terminator mythology is persistant enough we may see some more great content.,	3	Good enough for your Terminator fix,	12-09-2012
